Description: # Bionic
        
        Bionic is a framework for analyzing and modeling data in Python.  It's designed
        to help you **iterate faster on your research**, and help your colleagues
        **reuse your code more easily**.
        
        Bionic is in alpha and evolving rapidly.  We recommend it for research projects
        where the dataset fits in memory.  We do not recommend it for pipelines running
        in production.
        
        Check out the [full documentation](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
        or go straight to [Get
        Started](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get-started.html).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Bionic can be installed from PyPI:
        
            pip install bionic[standard]
        
        You'll probably want to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) as well.
        See the [Installation
        docs](https://bionic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get-started.html#installation)
