features:
  - |
    By default, reno now ignores "null" merge commits that bring in
    tags from other threads. The new configuration option
    ``ignore_null_merges`` controls this behavior. Setting the flag to
    False restores the previous behavior in which the null-merge
    commits were traversed like any other merge commit.
upgrade:
  - |
    The new configuration option ``ignore_null_merges`` causes the
    scanner to ignore merge commits with no changes when one of the
    parents being merged in has a release tag on it.
fixes:
  - |
    This release fixes a problem with the scanner that may have caused
    it to stop scanning a branch prematurely when the tag from another
    branch had been merged into the history.
