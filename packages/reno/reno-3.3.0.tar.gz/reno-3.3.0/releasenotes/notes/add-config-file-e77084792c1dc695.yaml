    Reno now supports having a ``config.yaml`` file in your release notes
    directory. It will search for file in the directory specified by
    ``--rel-notes-dir`` and parse it. It will apply whatever options are
    valid for that particular command. If an option is not relevant to a
    particular sub-command, it will not attempt to apply them.
