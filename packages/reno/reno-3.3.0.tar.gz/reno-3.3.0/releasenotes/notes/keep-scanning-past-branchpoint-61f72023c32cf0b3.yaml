    If no earliest version is provided for a branch, reno will scan commits
    on the branch in reverse order, attempting to find a common ancestor
    with the master branch. Once found, the last common commit - the branch
    point - is checked for a tag. Previously, if no tag was found, reno
    would stop scanning. This was problematic for instances where a branch
    was not created at the tagged commit but rather some commits later.
    Reno will now continue scanning until it finds a tag.
