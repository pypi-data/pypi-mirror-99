features:
  - |
    Explicitly allow reno to scan starting from a tag by specifying the
    tag where a branch name would otherwise be used.
  - |
    Add logic to allow reno to detect a branch that has been marked as
    end-of-life using the OpenStack community's process of tagging the
    HEAD of a stable/foo branch foo-eol before deleting the
    branch. This means that references to "stable/foo" are translated
    to "foo-eol" when the branch does not exist, and that Sphinx
    directives do not need to be manually updated.
