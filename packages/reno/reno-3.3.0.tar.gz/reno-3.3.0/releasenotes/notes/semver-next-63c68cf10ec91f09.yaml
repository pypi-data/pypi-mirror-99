    Add the ``semver-next`` command to calculate the next release
    version based on the available release notes. Three new
    configuration options (``semver_major``, ``semver_minor``, and
    ``semver_patch``) define the sections that should cause different
    types of version increments. See :doc:`/user/usage` for details.
