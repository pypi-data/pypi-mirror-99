    Add a configuration option ``branch_name_re`` to hold a regular expression
    for choosing "interesting" branches when trying to automatically detect
    how far back the scanner should look. The default is ``stable/.+``, which
    works for the OpenStack practice of creating branches named after the
    stable series of releases.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes the logic for determining how far back in history to look when
    scanning a given branch. Reno now looks for the base of the "previous"
    branch, as determined by looking at branches matching ``branch_name_re``
    in lexical order. This may not work if branches are created using
    version numbers as their names.
