    Previously, it was not possible build documentation that used the
    ``release-notes`` Sphinx extension from tarballs. The Sphinx extension
    will now search the following directories, relative to the working
    directory of the ``sphinx-build`` tool, to find the release notes
    directory: ``.``, ``..``, and ``../..``. This only applies when it is
    not possible to discover this information using git.
