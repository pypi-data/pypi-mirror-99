features:
  - Add a new configuration option, stop_at_branch_base, to control
    whether or not the scanner stops looking for changes at the point
    where a branch diverges from master. The default is True, meaning
    that the scanner does stop. A false value means that versions that
    appear on master from a point earlier than when the branch was
    created will be included when scanning the branch for release
    notes.
