    The automatic branch name handling is updated so that if the
    reference points explicitly to the origin remote, but that remote
    isn't present (as it won't be when zuul configures the repo in
    CI), then the shortened form of the reference without the prefix
    is used instead. This allows explicit references to
    ``origin/stable/name`` to be translated to ``stable/name`` and
    find the expected branch.
