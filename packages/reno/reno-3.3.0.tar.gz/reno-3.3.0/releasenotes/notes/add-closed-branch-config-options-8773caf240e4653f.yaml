    Adds new configuration options ``closed_branch_tag_re`` (to
    identify tags that replace branches that have been closed) and
    ``branch_name_prefix`` (a value to be added back to the closed
    branch tag to turn it into the original branch name.

    These options are used in OpenStack to support scanning the
    history of a branch based on the previous series branch, even
    after that previous series is closed by setting
    ``closed_branch_tag_re`` to ``(.+)-eol`` so that the series name
    in a value like ``"mitaka-eol"`` is extracted using the
    group. With ``branch_name_prefix`` set to ``"stable/"`` the tag
    ``mitaka-eol`` becomes the branch name ``stable/mitaka``.

    Fixes bug 1746076 so that scanning stable branches correctly
    includes the history of earlier closed stable branches.
