    Add the ability to specify regular expressions to a define a
    customised versioning scheme for release tags and pre-release tags.

    By default this change supports the current versioning scheme used by
    OpenStack.

    To customise, update the config.yaml file with the appropriate values.
    For example, for tags with versions like ``v1.0.0`` and pre-release
    versions like ``v1.0.0rc1`` the following could be added to config.yaml::

      release_tag_re: 'v\d\.\d\.\d(rc\d+)?'
      pre_release_tag_re: '(?P<pre_release>rc\d+$)'
