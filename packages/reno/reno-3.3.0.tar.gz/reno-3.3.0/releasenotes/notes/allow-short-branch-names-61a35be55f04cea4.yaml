    Fix a problem with branch references so that it is now possible to
    use a local tracking branch name when the branch only exists on
    the 'origin' remote. For example, this allows references to
    'stable/ocata' when there is no local branch with that name but
    there is an 'origin/stable/ocata' branch.
