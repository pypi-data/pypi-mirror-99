# BioSamples v4 Python Library

This is a small library which aims to provide a Python client
to access BioSamples v4 new API.

The client is still under heavy development, so any contribution is very
well welcomed.

Disclaimer: This is a test project and not officially supported by the AIT or BioSamples teams at this time.

## Local Development
This project uses [pipenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pipenv) to handle
both the virtual environment and the dependencies.
Follow the instructions available on pipenv site to see how to install it.

Once you have pipenv installed on you machine, just type
```bash
pipenv install
```
