        =======================================================
        A simple Python wrapper for the [last version of the Amazon Product Advertising API](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/quick-start/using-sdk.html). This module allows to get product information from Amazon using the official API in an easier way.

        Usage guide
        -----------
        **Basic usage:**
        
        ````python
        from amazon.paapi import AmazonAPI
        amazon = AmazonAPI(KEY, SECRET, TAG, COUNTRY)
        product = amazon.get_product('B01N5IB20Q')
        print(product.title)
        ````
        
        **Get multiple product information:**
        
        ````python
        product = amazon.get_products('B01N5IB20Q,B01F9G43WU')
        print(product[0].images.large)
        print(product[1].prices.price.value)
        ````
        
        **Use URL insted of ASIN:**
        
        ````python
        product = amazon.get_product('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5IB20Q')
        ````
        
        **Get product variations:**
        
        ````python
        product = amazon.get_variations('B01N5IB20Q')
        print(product[0].title)
        ````
        
        **Search product:**
        
        ````python
        product = amazon.search_products(item_count=25, keywords='speaker')
        print(product[14].url)
        ````
        
        **Get browse node information:**
        
        ````python
        node = amazon.get_browsenodes(browse_nodes=browsenodes_list)
        ````
        
        **Get the ASIN from a URL:**
        
        ````python
        from amazon.tools import get_asin
        asin = get_asin('https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5IB20Q')
        ````
        
        **Throttling:**
        
        Throttling value must be `greater than 0` or `False` to disable it. This value throttles requests to a maximum of one request every `1 / value` seconds. Note that this value is a per-worker throttling, so applications with multiple workers may make more requests per second. Throttling value is [set by default](https://github.com/sergioteula/python-amazon-paapi/blob/master/amazon/paapi.py#L36) to `0.8` or one request every 1.25 seconds.
        
        ````python
        amazon = AmazonAPI(KEY, SECRET, TAG, COUNTRY, throttling=0.5)  # Max one request every two seconds
        amazon = AmazonAPI(KEY, SECRET, TAG, COUNTRY, throttling=False)  # Unlimited requests per second
        ````
        
        **Serializer for Django:**
        
        We provide a serializer for Django REST framework, which speeds up your API
        implementation.
        
        ````python
        from amazon.serializers import AmazonProductSerializer
        from rest_framework import serializers
        
        serialized_product = AmazonProductSerializer(product)
        serialized_product.data
        ````
        
        If you want to serialize a list of products:
        
        ````python
        serialized_products = AmazonProductSerializer(products, many=True)
        serialized_products.data
        ````
        
        For more information on how to work with serializers, check the documentation for
        [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/).
