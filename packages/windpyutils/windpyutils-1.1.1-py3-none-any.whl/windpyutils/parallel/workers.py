    Representation of one parallel process that runs given function on data from shared queue :py:attr:`~WORK_QUEUE`
    (shared among all the others FunRunners). It expects that the data is tuple
    (IS_MEANT_FOR_IDS_BUT_CAN_BY_ANYTHING_YOU_WANT, data) or None.
    The None should be put into :py:attr:`~WORK_QUEUE` to terminate a FunRunner.

    The results are put into the :py:attr:`~RESULTS_QUEUE`.

    Example:
        procs = [FunRunner(pf=f) for _ in range(workers)]

            p.start()
