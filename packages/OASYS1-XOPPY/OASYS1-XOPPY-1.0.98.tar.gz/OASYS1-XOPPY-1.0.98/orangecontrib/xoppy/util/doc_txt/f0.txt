==================================   F0   ====================================


 f0 calculates Elastic Photon-Atom Scattering versus x=sin(theta/2)/lambda.

 The data are taken from the XRAYLIB data base.

This is a description of the input parameters for f0
====================================================


material: Select the desired material type. Three options are available:
	a) Element(formula) calculation for a single element.
	b) Compounds(formula) calculation for a compound. The user
		defines the compound formula.
		The syntaxis is the following: string with the chemical
		formula of the compound.
		Examples:
		H20
		SiO2
	c) Compounds(by name) from the NIST list of compounds.

table: Compound table, only available if the c) option in material is chosen.

formula: The element or compound formula, depending the "material"
		selection.

sin_theta/lambda [A**(-1)] grid: the abscissas values for the calculations. Two
		options are available:
		a) Standard, 515 points in the [0,8] interval.
		b) User-defined, with the parameters described below.

Form : the initial abscissa value (only available if b) is chosen)

To: the last abscissas value (only available if b) is chosen)

Number of points: the number of energy points (only available if b) is
		chosen in the "sin_theta/lambda grid" entry.
