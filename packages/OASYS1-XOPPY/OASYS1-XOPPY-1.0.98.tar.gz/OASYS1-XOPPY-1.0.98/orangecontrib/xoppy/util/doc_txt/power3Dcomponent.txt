==============================  power3Dcomponent   =====================================

 Power3Dcomponent calculates the transmission and absorption of the optical element
 as a function of the spatial coordinates and energies.
 It should be wired to a "Undulator Radiation" widget or use an input file created by it.

 It uses the XRAYLIB library to calculate reflectivities and transmissions.

 The idea is that power3Dcomponent projects the source as calculated by "Undulator Radiation"
 on a mirror or filter and computes the transmittance and absorbance (functions of the photon energy).

 The widget proposed also other elements:
 - an aperture that permits to crop the beam.
 - a screen rotation to project the source on a rotated plane (e.g., on a mirror)
 - a magnifier that permits to expand or contract the source by a factor.
   This is used to "propagate" the beam from element to element. In a beamline we calculate
   the source with "Undulator Radiation" at a given distance D0. This distance is usually defined
   where the first mirror M1 is placed, therefore the power on the mirror is calculated by projection
   on the mirror surface. Suppose the first mirror is plane, and we have a second mirror M2 at a distance D2.
   To propagate the beam from M1 to M2 we just define a new element that is a magnifier with magnification:
   D2 / D0. Therefore we will kave 4 widgets: Source (Undulator Radiation) , M1 (mirror), Drift space
   from M1 to M2 (magnifier) and M2.
   This situation can be generalized even using focusing mirrors. In that case the mirror magnification
   should be taken into acount to calculate the magnification in the drift spaces.

material: Three options are available:
	a) Element(formula): calculation for a single element.
	b) Compounds(formula):  calculation for a compound. The user
		defines the compound formula.
		The syntaxis is the following: string with the chemical
		formula of the compound.
		Examples:
		H20
		SiO2
