==============================   inpro   ======================================

 Inpro calculates perfect crystal reflectivity profiles.

 It interfaced the inpro (INtrinsic PROfiles) code, developed at the ESRF
 Optics Group in the late 80's and 90's. Inpro calculates the
 diffracted and transmitted profiles in reflection (Bragg) and transmission 
 (Laue) geometries for plane perfect crystals. 

Input parameters for xinpro:
============================

Crystal material: Select a crystal from this list of crystals.

Calculation Mode: select between BRAGG/LAUE  in REFLECTION/TRANSMISSION.

Energy [eV]: The photon energy.

Miller index h: obvious
Miller index k: obvious
Miller index l: obvious

Asymmetry angle: in degrees. For Laue, the asymmetry angle is defined as
  the angle between the crystal normal and the bragg plases. For Bragg,
  this is the angle between the crystal surface and the bragg planes. In
  other works, for Bragg-symmetrical alpha=0 and for Laue symmetrical
  alpha=0.

Crystal thickness [microns]

Crystal temperature [K]: NOTE: due to the Debye-Model parametrization
  used, T=0K is not valid!

Number of points

Angular limits: Set either automatic or external.

Theta min [arcsec]: The external minimum value of the scanning variable.

Theta max [arcsec]: The external maximum value of the scanning variable.
