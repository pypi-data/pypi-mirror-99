==============================  Wiggler   ====================================

 Wiggler calculates the spectrum of a Wiggler Synchrotron Radiation source.

 The Flux and Spectral Power values calculated with Wiggler
 correspond to the integration in FULL vertical and horizontal emission angles.

 Wiggler calculations are done using the program wiggler_spectrum, a python
 version of the Fortran program with the same name available in the SHADOW
 ray-tracing package.

Description of the input parameters for BM:
===========================================

MAGNETIC FIELD three possibilities:
  Sinusoidal or standard wiggler
  Asymmetric wiggler with magnetic field profile (for a single priod)
    from a two columns file (y[meters], B[Tesla])
    An example of this option can be found in the files ex3_b.dat
	in the $XOP_HOME/examples directory.
  Asymmetric wiggler with magnetic field calculated in function of a
    supplied file containing the harmonic expansion of the magnetic field
    profile. The file contains two columns: (# of harmonic, Bmax [T])
    An example of this option can be found in the files ex3_b.dat
    in the $XOP_HOME/examples directory.
