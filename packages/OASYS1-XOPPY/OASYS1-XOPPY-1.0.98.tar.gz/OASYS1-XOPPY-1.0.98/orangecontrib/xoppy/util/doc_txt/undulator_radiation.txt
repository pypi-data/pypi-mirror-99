! Method (N refers to the number of undulator periods):
!  METHOD  1    Non-zero emittance; finite-N
!  METHOD  2    Non-zero emittance; infinite-N
!  METHOD  3    Zero emittance;     finite-N
!  METHOD  4    Non-zero emittance; infinite-N + convolution (Dejus' approach)
!  METHOD 14    Non-zero emittance; infinite-N + convolution (Walker's approach)
!
!  Non-zero emittance; finite-N
!    - Required for MODE 1 "Angular/spatial flux density distribution."
!      Use also for MODE 6 "Power density and integrated power" (any non-zero emittance method may be used).
!      Not allowed for angle-intergrated spectra (MODE 5). Not recommended for other modes due to slow speed.
!  Non-zero emittance; infinite-N
!    - For test purposes; do not use (not available from the XOP menu).
!  Zero emittance; finite-N
!    - Use for zero emittance calculations. Not allowed for angle-integrated spectra (MODE 5).
!  Non-zero emittance; infinite-N/convolution
!    - Recommended for all runs with emittance.
!    - Only METHOD 4 (Dejus' approach) is available on the XOP menu. This method uses an internally
!      generated energy mesh with variable step size: at the location of the harmonics the step size
!      is made small and in between the harmonics the step size is made large.
!
! Harmonic Number:
!  IHARM   0    All harmonics
!  IHARM  -1    Lowest order harmonic (except MODE=6, include to harmonics -IHARM)
!  IHARM   I    I''th harmonic
!
!  All harmonics
!    - Selects all contributing harmonics (generally used).
!  Lowest order harmonic
!    - Selects the lowest order contributing harmonic.
!  Harmonic #
!    - Selects the harmonic number displayed.
!  Edit harmonic number (XOP Menu)
!    - Modifies the displayed harmonic number.
!    - For MODES 1,2,3,4 with METHOD 3 (zero emittance) the IHARM -1 is not used.
!
! Intrinsic Parameters:
!  Several internal parameters used in the calculations. They are commonly not modified
!  by the user. All parameters can be set to zero in which case they default to the values
!  given in the parenthesis.
!
!  NPHI    - Number of steps in angle phi between 0 and pi/2.0 (20).
!            Used in MODES 1,2,3,4,5 for non-zero emittance calculations.
!
!  NALPHA  - Number of steps in angle alpha (gamma*theta) (40).
!            Used in MODES 1,2,3,4 for METHOD 1 (non-zero emittance with finite-N).
!
!  CALPHA2 - Range of angles in alpha^2 in units of the angular equivalent of 1/N (2.0).
!            Used in MODES 1,2,3,4 for METHOD 1 (finite-N) and for METHOD 3 (zero emittance calculations).
!
!  NOMEGA  - Number of steps in photon energy for the natural lineshape (64).
!            Used in MODES 2,3,4,5 for METHOD 14 (infinite-N + convolution Walker's method).
!
!  COMEGA  - Range of photon energies to be included in the natural lineshape in units (energy of fundamental/N) (8.0)
!            The default value covers the range +/- 2/N of the natural lineshape.
!            Used in MODES 2,3,4,5 for METHOD 14 (infinite-N + convolution Walker's method).
!
!  NSIGMA  - Number of standard deviations of the electron beam size and divergence (4).
!            Used in MODES 1,2,3,4,6 for non-zero emittance calculations.
!
! Polarization:
!  The normalized Stokes parameters are calculated including the
!  unpolarized component.
!
!  NOTES:
!
!  1) For MODES 2,3,4,5 the finite-N spectrum is obtained by convoluting the infinite-N
!     spectrum with the natural lineshape. For Walker's method the point spacing in photon
!     energy must be the same for the two curves. This can be achieved as follows: set NEU=0,
!     in which case the spacing is set by the values of NOMEGA and COMEGA and NEU is set accordingly.
!     Set NEU to the approximate number of points desired in the energy range EMINU, EMAXU.
!     A new value of NEU is then calculated which gives the closest match with the spacing
!     of the natural lineshape. In either case EMAXU will also be adjusted so that the convolution
!     can be carried out correctly over the defined energy region.
!
!  2) If DU is set to zero, this indicates that angular flux and power density is to be calculated
!     rather than spatial flux and power density in MODEs 1,2,4 and 6. In this case SIGX and SIGY
!     are ignored, and the acceptance XPC, YPC, XPS, YPS is entered in mrad rather than mm units.
!
!  3) If the acceptance is centred on the axis (XPC=YPC=0.0) then only one quarter of the acceptance
!     needs to be calculated because of symmetry. In this case the range from (0,0) to (XPS/2.0,YPS/2.0)
!     will be divided into NXP,NYP intervals. The printed values of integrated flux and power, including
!     Stokes parameters will however be correct for the total acceptance.
!
!  4) The angle theta (alpha/gamma) is the angle between the undulator axis and the direction of observation.
!     The angle phi is the angle between the projection of the angle of observation in the x-y plane and the x-axis.
!
!  5) For MODE 6 "Power density and integrated power" with non-zero emittance an internally generated
!     cartesian grid is used and none of the intrinsic parameters are used except NSIGMA.
!
!  6) The definition of SIGX must include the contribution of the horizontal dispersion times the beam energy spread.
!     (The dispersion is not an input parameter and hence the user must enter the correct value of SIGX.)
!
!  7) The variable names of some parameters are changed when printed. For example DU is printed as D (distance).
!     EMINU is printed as EMIN, etc. The trailing "U" of a variable name indicates a user value. Some of those
!     are changed inside the code and the actual values used are printed.
!
! DESIGN ISSUES:
!  Program is based on the Bessel function approximation and is valid in the
!  far-field for an ideal sinusoidal magnetic field profile. It is further
!  based on the code URGENT by Richard P. Walker with added features.
!
! COPYRIGHT:
!  This routine may be used at The Advanced Photon Source and any other facility
!  without explicit consent of the author. No warranties are given as to the
!  accuracy of the results.

!
! MODIFICATION HISTORY:
!
!	 Date     | Name  | Description
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 06-JUL-1994     | RJD   | Modified value for E1MIN for angle-integrated
!                 |       | spectrum (MODE=5) to be non-zero; gamma*theta
!                 |       | corresponds to sqrt(200) (somewhat arbitrarily
!                 |       | chosen)
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 04-OCT-1994     | RJD   | Modified program to include polarization properties.
!                 |       | The four Stokes parameters are now calculated.
!                 |       | Program is for an ideal planar undulator or an ideal
!                 |       | elliptical undulator. Many other changes. The value
!                 |       | of the parameter IHARM has a different meaning.
!                 |       | IHARM=0 now gives 'all harmonics' and IHARM= <0
!                 |       | gives the lowest order harmonic except for the power
!                 |       | option. For the power option, a negative IHARM means
!                 |       | include all harmonics up to and including -IHARM.
!                 |       | This version is 1.6.
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 21-JUN-1995     | RJD   | Modified print-out of "Contributing harmonics" in
!		  |       | subroutine PRINT_OUT. Routine incorrectly calculated
!		  |       | IMIN and IMAX for METHOD 4 (Dejus method) for
!		  |       | "Spectral distributions". The spectra and integrated
!		  |       | quantities were calculated correctly and are
!		  |       | unaffected by this modification.
!                 |       | The current version is 1.7.
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 04-JAN-1996     | RJD   | Modified the number of decimal places for the sigx1
!                 |       | and sigy1 variables to four in the printout. Added
!                 |       | one more digit for the emax variable to avoid
!                 |       | overflow on rare occasions. Formats 260 and 256 were
!                 |       | changed accordingly.
!                 |       | The current version is 1.8.
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 11-NOV-1997     | RJD   | Changed notation: Brightness -> Brilliance.
!                 |       | The current version is 1.9.
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 16-JUL-2000     | RJD   | Minor change in the code to compile error-free on
!                 |       | Unix and Windows (no change in results vs. v1.9).
!                 |       | Current version is v1.91.
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 02-NOV-2013     | RJD   | Updated date and time routines.
!                 |       | Changed printout of number of decimal places for sigx and sigy.
!                 |       | Increased the number of subdivisions of the pinhole
!                 |       | from 50 to 200 (P_SZ=201).
!                 |       | Changed rank of variable "SL" to become an array in subroutine
!                 |       | ANGLE_INTEGRATION to avoid compilation warning with gfortran.
!                 |       | Current version is v1.92.
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 10-JUN-2014     | RJD   | Updated so that an arbitrary input file can be used on the command line.
!                 |       | If no input file is given on the command line then the file 'us.dat'
!                 |       | is assumed ('us.inp' for the XOP version). The output filename is created
!                 |       | from the rootname, which is derived from the input filename using the string after
!                 |       | the last directory separator (/) without its trailing file extension (if it exists).
!                 |       | The output filename is the rootname with the extension (.plt) appended (.out for the
!                 |       | XOP version). Search "standalone" for changing defaults.
!                 |       | Current version is v1.93.
! ----------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------------
! 22-OCT-2014     | RJD   | Added beam energy spread to all modes and introduced parameter SIGE.
!                 |       | Uses routine econ_func() to do the energy convolution.
!                 |       | NOTE: the definition of SIGX remains unchanged and it must include the value of the
!                 |       | horizontal dispersion times the beam energy spread.
!                 |       | Fixed error in SUBROUTINE CONVOLUTE_ENERGY_VSTEP. The array HE() was
!                 |       | accessed with index 0 (out of bounds for J2 = 1). See RJD 10/23/2014.
!                 |       | Fix has no effect on the results because the calculated spectra SP1 would
!                 |       | typically be zero at the boundary.
!                 |       | Completely rewritten to take advantage of modern Fortran 90/95 features including dynamic
!                 |       | allocation of arrays. Array size limitations were removed. Warnings are given if predefined array
!                 !       ! sizes are exceeded but code will run ok although execution times may be quite large.
!                 !       ! Rewrote algorithm for power density distributions (MODE 6) for the non-zero emittance case.
!                 !       ! Now uses a cartesian coordinates for the convolution. Previously used polar coordinates and it gave
!                 !       ! spurios/unreal results for small values of the beam divergence.
!                 |       | Increased values of default parameters NALPHA, NSIGMA, NOMEGA, and COMEGA.
!                 |       | Numerous checks added.
!                 |       | Current version is v1.94.

The following are complete up-to-date instructions for running URGENT.
Please use the latest version available.

1. INTRODUCTION

 URGENT is designed for the accurate and efficient calculation of
the basic properties (angular, spectral, polarization, power density)
of the radiation generated in ideal plane, helical or elliptical undulators,
and also the crossed-undulators scheme [Nikitin,Kim].

 It can take into account :
- non-zero electron beam emittance (size and divergence)
- finite number of undulator periods (N)
- multiple harmonics contributing at a given photon energy
but also has options for :
- zero emittance
- infinite N
- single harmonic

 The main approximations are :
- ideal electron trajectory (i.e. no tapering or field errors)
- far-field.

 It is written in standard FORTRAN 77, calls no library routines,
and needs no graphics package and so should be easily transportable.

 URGENT uses the Bessel function method to calculate the basic radiation
angular flux density function in an efficient manner. An appropriate
choice is made of routine depending on whether the magnet is plane or
helical, in order to minimize cpu time.

LINE 6 : Calculation Parameters
- All of the following parameters can be set to zero in which
case they default to the values given in brackets [].

NPHI -   no. of steps in phi between 0 and pi/2.0 [20]. NPHI < 100.
         used in (MODE=1,2,3,4,5 ICALC=1,2)
NSIG -   no. of standard deviations of electron beam dimensions (size and
         divergence) to be included [4].
         used in (MODE=1,2,3,4 ICALC=1,2) and (MODE=6 ICALC=1)
NALPHA - no. of steps in angle alpha (gamma*theta) [15]. NALPHA < 100.
         used in (MODE=1 ICALC=1).
DALPHA - range of angles in alpha**2 to be used, in units of the angular
         equivalent of 1/N [2.0].
         used in (MODE=1 ICALC=1) and ICALC=3.
NOMEGA - no. of steps in photon energy for the natural lineshape [16].
         NOMEGA < 5000.
         used in (MODE=2,3,4,5 ICALC=1)
DOMEGA - range of photon energies to be included in the natural lineshape
         in units (energy of fundamental/N) [2.0] i.e. the default value
         covers the range +/- 2/N of the natural lineshape.
         used in (MODE=2,3,4,5 ICALC=1)


NOTES :

i/ For (MODE=2,3,4,5 ICALC=1 ITYPE=1) the finite N spectrum is obtained by
convoluting the infinite N spectrum with the natural lineshape.
To make this easy the point spacing in photon energy must be the same
for the two curves. This can be achieved as follows :
- set NE=0, in which case the spacing is set by the values of NOMEGA and
  DOMEGA and NE is set accordingly.
- set NE to the approximate number of points desired in the energy range
  EMIN,EMAX. A new value of NE is then calculated which gives the closest
  match with the spacing of the natural lineshape.
In either case  EMAX will also be adjusted so that the convolution
can be carried out correctly over the defined energy region.
In order to get an accurate convolution the program insists that
the rule (NOMEGA/DOMEGA) >= 4 is respected.

ii/ In cases with non-zero emittance (MODE=1,2,3,4,ICALC=1,2 and MODE=6,
ICALC=1) both SIGX and SIGY may be zero, but both SIGX1 and SIGY1 must
be non-zero.

iii/ If D is set to zero, this indicates that angular flux and power density
is to be calculated rather than spatial flux and power density in MODEs
1,2,4 and 6. In this case SIGX and SIGY are ignored, and the acceptance
(XPC, YPC, XPS, YPS) is entered in mrad rather than mm units.

iv/ If the acceptance is centred on the axis (XPC=YPC=0.0) then only
one quarter of the acceptance needs to be calculated because of symmetry.
In this case the range from (0,0) to (XPS/2.0,YPS/2.0) will be divided
into NXP, NYP intervals. The printed values of integrated flux and power,
including Stokes parameters will however be correct for the total acceptance.

v/ Theta (alpha/gamma) is the angle between the undulator axis and the
direction of observation. Phi is the angle between the projection of the
angle of observation in the x-y plane and the x-axis.

vi/ MODE=6 : In addition to power density the program now also prints total
flux density (photons/s/mrad**2 or mm**2), and as well as integrated power
the total flux (photons/s). The central value means at the centre of the
defined acceptance in the case of a 2D acceptance (NXP>0, NYP>0). In other
cases it refers to the first point. It is permitted to enter NXP=0 or NYP=0
to obtain values of the power density for example as a function of vertical
or horizontal position (angle) respectively.

vii/ For the crossed undulator (ITYPE=2) the following special rules apply :
- KX is set to 0.0; both undulators are assummed to have deflection parameter KY
- each undulator is assumed to have N periods
- only MODE = 1, 2 or 4 can be used
- NPHI <= 25
- The calculation method is different to that for standard
magnets (ITYPE=1); finite N is taken into account directly and no
convolution with the natural lineshape is necessary. ICALC=1 or ICALC=2
can be entered equally; NOMEGA and DOMEGA are irrelevant. DALPHA is needed
in all cases, NALPHA for ICALC=1,2.

3. DATA OUTPUT

Data are output on unit 6 (FOR006). In all cases the main data start on line 33.

The input parameters are firstly printed. Parameters on lines 1,2,4,6 that
are not relevant for the type of calculation required are set to zero.
The on-axis photon energy and wavelength, and the total power and peak power
density (zero emittance) are also given. The power density is only given for
the plane and helical (KX=KY) case.

The units used throughout are as follows :

Photon energy                   [eV]
Wavelength                      [Angstrom]
Spatial flux density=Irradiance [photons/s/mm**2/0.1%bandwidth]
Angular flux density            [photons/s/mrad**2/0.1%bandwidth]
Brightness                      [photons/s/mm**2/mrad**2/0.1%bandwidth]
Flux                            [photons/s/0.1%bandwidth]
Spectral power density          [Watts/mm**2 or mrad**2/eV bandwidth]
Power density                   [Watts/mm**2 or mrad**2]
Spectral power                  [Watts/eV bandwidth]
Power                           [Watts]


4. POLARIZATION

 Angular/spatial flux densities and integrated flux are given in terms
of polarization parameters l1, l2, l3, l4 where :
   l1 = s1/s0  l2 = s2/s0  l3 = s3/s0
   and l4 = 1 - sqrt((l1**2)+(l2**2)+(l3**2))
s0, s1, s2 and s3 are the Stokes parameters, integrated over the
beam emittance, range of acceptance etc. :
   s0 = total intensity
   s1 = difference in intensity between radiation polarized linearly in the
        horizontal direction and in the vertical direction
   s2 = difference in intensity between radiation polarized linearly in the
        directions at +45 degrees and -45 degrees with respect to the
        horizontal and vertical directions
   s3 = difference in intensity between radiation polarized circularly in the
        right-handed and left-handed sense
Thus, the fraction of radiation that is polarized is
                  sqrt((l1**2)+(l2**2)+(l3**2))
and l4 represents the fraction of radiation that is unpolarized.
l1, l2 and l3 vary between -1 and +1; l4 varies between 0 and 1.
Note the change in definition of l4 from URGENT version 2. It now is in
agreement with the definition of Born and Wolf, Principles of Optics p.555.

 With the assumption that the undulator fields are parallel to the x and y
axes, and that electron beam distributions that are symmetrical with respect
to the x and y axes -
In general : l2 = 0 on-axis, or with an acceptance that is symmetric with
respect to the x and y axes
In a plane undulator (KX=0, KY#0) : l3 = 0 always


5. COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS

 In a program of this sort it is impossible to guarantee that sensible
results will be obtained in all circumstances. Thus, the user should (as with
any reasonably complicated computer program) judge himself whether the
results are sensible by the usual techniques of changing the input
parameters (e.g. number of energy intervals, number of points in the
acceptance etc.) in order to check that the results remain reasonably
consistent, or change in the expected way (changing for example the
emittance parameters, or choosing options for infinite N etc.)

 In most cases the default values for parameters in line 6 are appropriate,
i.e. enter 0 0 0 0 0 0.

 The default values should give accurate values of the flux to a level
of the order 0.1% of the main peak. If accuracy is wanted to lower values,
it may be necessary to increase NSIG (e.g. 6).

 For MODE=1,2,3,4,5 if in doubt use IHARM=-1; the data output will include
information on which harmonics were actually used in the calculation.

 For MODE=2,3,4,5 there is little difference in the calculation time for
spectra with ICALC=1 or 2, however ICALC=2 allows the photon energy interval
to be set independently of any natural lineshape criterion, which can be
useful for either a preliminary calculation or in some particular cases [e.g.
at high photon energies compared to the first harmonic where the infinite
N approximation is a good approximation to the finite N result].

 For cases with small emittance and small photon energy ICALC=3 can
be a reasonable approximation (MODE=1,2,3,4).

 For cases with large emittance and large photon energy ICALC=2 can
be a reasonable approximation (MODE=1,2,3,4).

 For MODE=6, when the electron beam emittance (divergence) is small
compared to 1/gamma, ICALC=2 is a good approximation. When the emittance
and pinhole are sufficiently small that different harmonics in the spectrum
do not overlap, the power density and integrated power in the individual
harmonics can conveniently be calculated directly (IHARM=0), rather than by
spectral calculations for each separate harmonic.

 Some problems can occur in computing spectra in the case with small
emittance and small photon energy i.e. the "diffraction limited" case.
Here it is necessary to make sure that the infinite N spectrum first
calculated by the program is sensible - i.e. has sufficient points in
it (determined by the photon energy interval used) and in the case of
integrating over a pinhole is suitably "smooth" (determined by the
spacing of points in the pinhole). A reasonable criterion for the
latter is that the spacing XPS/NXP should be as follows :
           XPS/NXP < 2.0 * SQRT((SIGX*SIGX)+(D*D*SIGX1*SIGX1))
and the same in the vertical plane.

6. USING THE PROGRAM

 The FORTRAN source program comes in a single part : URGENT.FOR
which should be compiled and linked to form an executable program.
No external routines are called. Although the program has been developed on
a VAX, it compiles under FOR/STANDARD and has also been compiled on a PC.

 Most calculations can be performed in an interactive mode
in a few seconds to a few minutes cpu time. A simple VAX
COM file to run the program URGENT.EXE reading the data from INP.DAT and
outputing to OUT.DAT is as follows :

   $ ASSIGN INP.DAT FOR005
   $ ASSIGN OUT.DAT FOR006
   $ RUN URGENT
   $ DEASS FOR005
   $ DEASS FOR006
   $ EXIT

 A sample input file is as follows :

   1 0.056 0.0 3.39 0.0 81
   295. 303. 0
   2.0 0.4 0.228 0.044 0.033 0.017
   20.0   0. 0. 2. 2. 10 10
   4 1 3
   0 0 0 0 0 0

In this example the flux is integrated over a 2 mm x 2 mm
pinhole 20 m from the source, for a 5.6 cm period undulator in ELETTRA
at 2 GeV 400mA, near the third harmonic. The photon energy range is defined,
but not the interval - which is determined by the program for compatibility
with the natural lineshape. For this run the calculation time on a VAXSTATION
3100/MOD.30 is 21 s for 27 photon energy points.
