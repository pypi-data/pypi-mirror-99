==================================   fh      ==================================

 XFH calculates structure factor of crystals.

 The data are taken from the XRAYLIB data base.


This is a description of the input parameters for fh
====================================================


CRYSTAL: Select a crystal from this list of crystals.

h MILLER INDEX: obvious
k MILLER INDEX: obvious
l MILLER INDEX: obvious

TEMPERATURE FACTOR: Three possibilites:
       Enter the exp(-M) value (a positive value between 0 and 1)


FROM ENERGY [eV]: the starting photon energy for the calculation.

TO ENERGY [eV]: the starting photon energy for the calculation.

NUMBER OF POINTS: the number of points for the energy grid.
	If set to 1, only the minimum energy point is calculated.
