Description: Sanskrit
        ========
        
        For usage of this library, and for other tasks such as `sandhi` joining/splitting,
        sentence parsing, etc., please see the
        [sanskrit_parser](https://github.com/kmadathil/sanskrit_parser/) library.
        
        The `sandhi` and `sounds` modules are not fully featured currently,
        and are unlikely to be developed due to the availability of better maintained packages.
        
        ## Original description:
        
        This is a general-purpose package for dealing with Sanskrit data of any kind.
        It currently operates at and below the word level and below, with modules like:
        
        - `query`, for accessing linguistic data
        - `sandhi`, for applying and undoing sandhi changes
        - `sounds`, for testing sounds and getting the meter of a phrase
        
        Soon the package will move up to the word and sentence levels. Once there, it
        will provide tools for inflecting, analyzing, tagging, and parsing Sanskrit.
