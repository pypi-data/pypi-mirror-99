Version 3.2.1.0
===============

* Depend on sale_shop module

  The sale shop module implements the concept of real world shops
  which have a different warehouse they send inventory from, the
  different price list and everything else needed for a shop to
  function independently. The changes to website (previously) did
  this too. However, from this version such information will be
  fetched from the shop.

  Warning: There is no migration for this. You will have to create
  a new shop on your own and update your website to have the new
  pricelist.

* Price list for anonymous users

  Previous versions used the pricelist of the guest user (if one
  was defined) to price products for guest users. From this version,
  the anonymous user prices are the prices of the shop (from the
  price list of shop).

  Migration: Ensure that you set the pricelist of the shop as the
  same pricelist that was set for the guest user.
