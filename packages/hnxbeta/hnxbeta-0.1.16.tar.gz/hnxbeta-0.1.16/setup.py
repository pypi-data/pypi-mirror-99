      Hnxbeta is a development version of HyperNetX
      intended for super users to test and give feedback.
      Please install in a virtual environment and send comments 
      and bug reports to `hypernetx@pnnl.gov`. 

      The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for complex network data.
      HyperNetX uses data structures designed to represent set systems containing
      nested data and/or multi-way relationships. The library generalizes traditional
      graph metrics to hypergraphs. It can be found at `https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX`

      Hnxbeta has C++ support available from the NWHypergraph library.
      It is available via `pip install nwhy`.
      This library is still in development and will be updated frequently on PyPI.
      At present it is only available for OSX and Centos7.
      To use, first `conda install tbb` in your environment, note that pip does not
      install the correct version of tbb at present.
