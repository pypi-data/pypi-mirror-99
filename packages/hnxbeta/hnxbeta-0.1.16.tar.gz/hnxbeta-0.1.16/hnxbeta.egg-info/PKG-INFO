Description: 
              Hnxbeta is a development version of HyperNetX
              intended for super users to test and give feedback.
              Please install in a virtual environment and send comments 
              and bug reports to `hypernetx@pnnl.gov`. 
        
              The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for complex network data.
              HyperNetX uses data structures designed to represent set systems containing
              nested data and/or multi-way relationships. The library generalizes traditional
              graph metrics to hypergraphs. It can be found at `https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX`
        
              Hnxbeta has C++ support available from the NWHypergraph library.
              It is available via `pip install nwhy`.
              This library is still in development and will be updated frequently on PyPI.
              At present it is only available for OSX and Centos7.
              To use, first `conda install tbb` in your environment, note that pip does not
              install the correct version of tbb at present.
