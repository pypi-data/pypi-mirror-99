Hnxbeta is a development version of HyperNetX
intended for super users to test and give feedback.
Please install in a virtual environment and send comments 
and bug reports to `hypernetx@pnnl.gov`. 

The HyperNetX library provides classes and methods for complex network data.
HyperNetX uses data structures designed to represent set systems containing
nested data and/or multi-way relationships. The library generalizes traditional
graph metrics to hypergraphs. It can be found at `https://github.com/pnnl/HyperNetX`

Hnxbeta has C++ support available from the NWHypergraph library.
It is available via `pip install nwhy`.
This library is still in development and will be updated frequently on PyPI.
At present it is only available for OSX and Centos7.
To use, first `conda install tbb` in your environment, note that pip does not
install the correct version of tbb at present.
