Welcome to Lcapy's documentation!
=================================

Lcapy is a Python package for linear circuit analysis.  It uses
SymPy (symbolic Python) for symbolic analysis.  As well as circuit analysis, Lcapy can semi-automate the drawing of high-quality schematics from a netlist, including diodes, transistors, and other non-linear components.  It can also symbolically transform both continuous-time and discrete-time signals.
