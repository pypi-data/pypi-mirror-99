# mosaik.Multi-Project

Tooling for setting up and maintaining multiple (mosaik) projects.

## Motivation

[mosaik](https://mosaik.offis.de/) scenarios often contain multiple simulators.
Sometimes, additional packages need to be developed alongside of them.
Managing such a set of loosely coupled *projects* becomes laborious easily.
This project provides tooling for some common *operations* on projects.
These operations range from cloning the repository to building a docker image. 
Operations can be run in parallel on projects, enabling quite some automation.

## Status

The code of this project was largely in operation in the Designetz project.

## One-line Execution

mosaik.Multi-Project can be run as a container directly from GitLab.com:

    docker run registry.gitlab.com/offis.energy/mosaik/mosaik.multi-project:latest --help

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.6+
-   git
