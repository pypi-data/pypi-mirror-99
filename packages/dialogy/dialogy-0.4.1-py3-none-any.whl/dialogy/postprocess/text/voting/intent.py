    An instance of VoteIntentPlugin helps in voting for a strong
    evidence over other candidates.

    **threshold**: Signal strength should atleast match this value, or else it will be dropped.

    This plugin takes into consideration a list of predictions (signals)
    some of which can be strong, (decided by their confidence score for now)
    and weak signals are filtered out. If there is a healthy vote proportion,
    we will consider the winning signal as the true output.

    This class handles signals which are produced by an intent classifier that
    classifies a set of ASR alternatives (strings).

    The voting algorithm here is naive as it is based on heuristics
    and plain counting. This can be improved by using learned trees/forests.

    Ideal design should provide the signals, their strengths (confidence) and
    signal boosters, any contextual information that implies a weak signal has
    more weight than its counterparts.
