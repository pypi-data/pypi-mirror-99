    Join ASR output to single string.

    This function provides a merging strategy for n-best ASR transcripts by
    joining each transcript, such that:

    - each sentence end is marked by " &lt;/s&gt;" and,
    - sentence start marked by " &lt;s&gt;".


    The key "transcript" is expected in the ASR output, the value of which would be operated on
    by this function.

    Example:
    ```python

    input = [
        {"transcript": "This is a sentence"},
        {"transcript": "That is a sentence"}
    ]

    "<s> This is a sentence </s> <s> That is a sentence </s>"

    - utterances (`List[Utterance]`): ASR transcriptions


    Raises:

    - KeyError: Missing key `"transcript"` within alternatives.


    Returns:
