# Sample SQL Jinja template to generate Firebase Analytics features from windows of facts.
# Args:
#   windows_table: input BigQuery table name containing windows, e.g. from sliding_windows.sql
#   features_table: output BigQuery table name to write the features.
#
# We recommend using automatic_feature_generation.sql instead. If you want to manually specify
# features, use this file as a guide and overwrite it with the features you want to extract. Several
# example features are included below for reference, though you are not limited to these.
#
# Output schema:
#   window_start_ts: TIMESTAMP,
#   window_end_ts: TIMESTAMP,
#   snapshot_ts: TIMESTAMP
#   user_id: STRING
#   label: type defined in prediction_window_conversions_to_label.sql
#   <FeatureName1>: <FeatureType1>
#   <FeatureName2>: <FeatureType2>
#   ...
