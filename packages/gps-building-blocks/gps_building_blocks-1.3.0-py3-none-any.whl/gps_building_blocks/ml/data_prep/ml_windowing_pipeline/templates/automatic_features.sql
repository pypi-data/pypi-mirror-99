# SQL Jinja template to automatically generate features from windows.
# Args:
#   windows_table: input BigQuery table name containing windows, e.g. from sliding_windows.sql
#   numeric_facts: Iterable[Fact] of numeric facts computed by facts.py
#   categorical_facts: Iterable[Fact] of categorical facts computed by facts.py
#   fact_name_to_value_and_column_suffix: Mapping[str, Iterable[Tuple[str, str]] map
#     from fact_name to list of (string_value, column_suffix) pairs. Used to generate features
#     per fact value (as a string), with column_suffix as the legal BigQuery column name suffix.
#     This map can be generated from rank_categorical_fact_values_by_count, which extracts the
#     top N values by count per categorical fact.
#   features_table: output BigQuery table name to write the features.
#
# Implementation Note:
# The simplest and fastest implementation for feature extraction consists of one large query, with
# one subquery for each feature column. However, even for relatively small examples, this query will
# be too large for the BigQuery planner (even if the query is fast to run).
# Another option is to extract the features, one type at a time, and then to join the subtables into
# one large table. When there are lots of windows, the joins can be very slow.
# This implementation builds the features up one type at a time. It keeps all the window facts, so
# that the next feature can reference them when the feature columns are added. This means the window
# facts and previous features get written over and over again as the set of features is built up.
# The main advantage of this approach is that there are no joins and so it is much faster.
