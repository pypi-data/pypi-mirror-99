-- Calculate statistics for categorical features in the Features table in BigQuery.
-- Features table is created by the
-- FeaturesPipeline of the MLWindowingPipeline tool. For more info:
-- https://github.com/google/gps_building_blocks/tree/master/py/gps_building_blocks/ml/data_prep/ml_windowing_pipeline
--
-- Query expects following parameters:
-- `bq_features_table`: Full path to the Features Table in BigQuery. Ex: project.dataset.table.
-- `struct_column_list_sql`: An SQL code segment containing a comma separated list of column names
--  formatted as follows: STRUCT('column' AS feature, column AS value).
