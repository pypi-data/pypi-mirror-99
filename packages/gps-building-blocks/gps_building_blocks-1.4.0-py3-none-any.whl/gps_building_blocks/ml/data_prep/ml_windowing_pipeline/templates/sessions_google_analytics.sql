# Sample SQL Jinja template to extract Google Analytics (GA) BigQuery data into an internal format.
# Args:
#   analytics_table: input Google Analytics BigQuery tablename.
#   sessions_table: output sessions BigQuery tablename.
#
# This is only a sample file. Override it with your own query that extracts the session information
# you want to train over. Every row/session in the Google Analytics BigQuery table has up to
# approximately 350 facts. For efficiency, only extract the data you need.
#
# Note that the input data is not limited to GA data. You can rewrite this query to extract data
# from Firebase, or even your own CRM data. The only requirement is that the output of the query
# matches the following schema:
#
# Output schema:
#   user_id: STRING
#   session_ts: TIMESTAMP (timestamp of the start of the session)
#   session_id: STRING (unique id for the session)
#
# And then any number of facts, where a fact is a STRUCT containing a value and a timestamp. All
# facts with the same name must be grouped together in the same array.
#   factname: STRUCT REPEATED
#   factname.value: ANY TYPE
#   factname.ts: TIMESTAMP
#
# Use the query below as a guide for how to extract facts. Take special note of how
# customDimensions and hits are extracted as they demonstrate two opposed approaches to preserving
# the order of events.
#
# In the input GA data, customDimensions is a repeated array of pair records, as below:
#  customDimensions	RECORD	REPEATED
#  customDimensions.index	INTEGER
#  customDimensions.value	STRING
# Note that the ith index represents one concept across all rows, e.g. CRM id of the customer, or
# country of origin, etc. The ith index has no relation to the index before or after it. To
# represent this as a fact, we create a fact name customDimensions<i>, with value equal to the
# ith value in the GA customDimensions array.
#
# Similarly, in the input GA data, hits are a repeated array of records. For this script, we are
# not interested in differentiating between the say first hit and second hit (although that could
# make a good feature). Instead, we just want to collect all pagePaths for example that were hit in
# the session, with no regard to the order. In the script below, give pagePath values the same fact
# name hits.page.pagePath so they are collected together in the same array. This contracts to the
# customDimensions approach where we might have facts like hits1.page.pagePath, hits2.page.pagePath
# and so on.
