# SQL Jinja template to output instances based on user activity over time.
# Args:
#   sessions_table: input sessions BigQuery tablename from the output of sessions.sql
#   snapshot_start_date: first date to create a snapshot summary (STRING with format 'YYYY-MM-DD')
#   snapshot_end_date: last date to create a snapshot summary (STRING with format 'YYYY-MM-DD')
#   timezone: Timezone for the Google Analytics Data, e.g. "Australia/Sydney", or "+11:00"
#   slide_interval_in_days: number of days between successive snapshot summary dates
#   conversions_table: input conversions BigQuery tablename from the output of conversions.sql
#   prediction_window_gap_in_days:
#       ignore conversions before this many days following the snapshot summary date
#   prediction_window_size_in_days:
#       ignore conversion after this many days following the snapshot summary date +
#       prediction_window_gap_in_days
#   prediction_window_conversions_to_label.sql: SQL file that converts an array of conversions into
#       a label. This file is included automatically. However, it needs to be edited to include
#       the specific logic for converting conversions into labels.
#   instances_table: output BigQuery tablename to write the instances.
#
# Each row in the output is an instance based on all the activity for one user up to the snapshot
# date, and also includes the array of any conversions from the following prediction window. Note
# that the snapshot_start_date is just the first date that an instance is produced. A user's first
# activity can occur before this date.
