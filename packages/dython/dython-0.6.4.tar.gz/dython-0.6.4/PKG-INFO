Description: # Dython
        
        A set of **D**ata analysis tools in p**YTHON** 3.x.
        
        **Key features:**
        * Measures of association for categorical features
        * Plot features correlation and association for mixed data-sets (categorical and continuous features) 
        in an easy and simple way
        * Plot ROC curves with AUC scores and estimated-optimal thresholds 
        
        Dython was designed with analysis usage in mind - meaning ease-of-use, functionality and readability are the core 
        values of this library. Production-grade performance, on the other hand, were not considered.
