Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Tracking server plugin for Python
===================================================================
The azureml-contrib-run package used to contain the integration code of AzureML with Mlflow.
We have now updated the library to integrate with Mlflow 1.0 and are now moving out of contrib.

The azureml.contrib.mlflow integration is now deprecated for the latest bits:

pip install azureml-mlflow
