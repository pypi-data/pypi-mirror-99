note that this package is **still in development**
at this stage, I'm only building thing as they come to mind  
version 1.0 will be the first major release  
until then, consider this code heavily volatile

Note: portions of this code have Fortran backends that may need to be built prior to successful use of the code. We
have it on our to-do list to compile OS-specific wheels.

yet, install simply by calling `pip install molecular` or `pip install --pre molecular` for the latest development
release.

we endeavor to follow https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/performance.html
