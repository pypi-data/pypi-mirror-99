        ## An Interactive Image Segmentation Filter for Multiplex Microscopy.
        
        CyLinter cleans image-derived, single-cell data by identifying and removing cell segmentation instances in multiplexed whole tissue and tissue microarray images corrupted by optical and/or image preprocessing artifacts. The tool comprises a set of user-guided, quality control (QC) modules instantiated in a configurable [Python](https://www.python.org) Class. The results of each module are cached to allow for dynamic restarts and iterative QC strategies.
        
        CyLinter development is led by [Greg Baker](https://github.com/gjbaker) at [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/), Harvard Medical School.
