Here you can find some examples generated from jupyter notebooks that show you how to get up and running with *Starfish*. The workflows presented offer a good starting point to begin diving into all that *Starfish* has to offer. Since the documents are generated from notebooks, you can download a copy and run them yourself with little to no fuss. The notebooks are hosted in the `examples directory <https://github.com/iancze/starfish/tree/master/examples>`_ of the GitHub repository.
