    values that this invariant accepts as "correct". Invariants have a custom ``__new__`` method 
    that returns the value of calling the :py:meth:`run<invariant.run>` method, making them

        Returns a list of values that this invariant accepts as correct.

        Takes in a list of acceptable values from a :py:class:`Value<pybryt.Value>` annotation and
        returns a list of values that would evaluate as "the same" under the conditions of this 
        invariant.

        For example, if ``values`` as a list with a single element, a numpy matrix, and the 
        invariant was matrix transposition, this method would return a length-2 list containing the
        original matrix and its transpose.

        Args:
            values (``list[object]``): acceptable values, either from the initial constructor call
                of the annotation or from the results of other invariants
