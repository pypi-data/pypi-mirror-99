    Threading issues with the kafka-python consumer client were identified
    and documented. The driver has been updated to integrate the
    confluent-kafka python library. The confluent-kafka client
    leverages the high performance librdkafka C client and is safe
    for multiple thread use.

    With the change in the client library used, projects using the
    Kafka driver should use extras oslo.messaging[kafka] to pull in
    dependencies for the driver.
