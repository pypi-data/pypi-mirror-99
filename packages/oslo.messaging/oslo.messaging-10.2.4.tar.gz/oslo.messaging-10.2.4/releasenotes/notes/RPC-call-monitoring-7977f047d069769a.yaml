    RPCClient now supports RPC call monitoring for detecting the loss
    of a server during an RPC call.

  - |
    RPC call monitoring is a new RPCClient feature.  Call monitoring
    causes the RPC server to periodically send keepalive messages back
    to the RPCClient while the RPC call is being processed.  This can
    be used for early detection of a server failure without having to
    wait for the full call timeout to expire.
