    In combination with amqp<=2.4.0, ``oslo.messaging`` was unreliable
    when configured with TLS (as is generally recommended). Users would
    see frequent errors such as this::

      MessagingTimeout: Timed out waiting for a reply to message ID ae039d1695984addbfaaef032ce4fda3

    Such issues would typically lead to downstream service timeouts,
    with no recourse available other than disabling TLS altogether
    (see `bug 1800957
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.messaging/+bug/1800957>`_).

    The underlying issue is fixed in amqp version 2.4.1, which is now
    the minimum version that ``oslo.messaging`` requires.
