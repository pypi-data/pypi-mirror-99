    On rabbitmq, in the past, acknownlegement of messages was done within the
    application callback thread/greenlet. This thread was blocked until the
    message was ack. In newton, we rewrote the message acknownlegement to
    ensure we haven't two threads writting the socket at the same times.
    Now all pendings ack are done by the main thread. They are no more reason
    to block the application callback thread until the message is ack. Other
    driver already release the application callback threads before the message
    is acknownleged. This is also the case for rabbitmq, now.
