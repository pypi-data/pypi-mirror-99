The Music Library Data Structures
*********************************

This page contains a thorough introduction to the data structures used
for the music library items\ [#music_library_items]_. The data
structures are implemented in the :py:mod:`soco.data_structures`
module and they are used to represent the metadata for music items,
such as music tracks, albums, genres and playlists.

Many music related items have a lot of metadata in common. For example, a music
track and an album may both have artist and title metadata. It is therefore
possible and useful to derive a hierarchy of items, and to implement them as a
class hierarchy. The hierarchy which Sonos has adopted is represented by the
`DIDL Lite xml schema <http://www.upnp.org/schemas/av/didl-lite-v2.xsd>`_ (DIDL
stands for 'Digital Item Description Language'. For more details, see the `UPnP
specifications (PDF)
<http://www.upnp.org/specs/av/UPnP-av-ContentDirectory-v1-Service.pdf>`_.

In the ``data_structures`` module, each class represents a particular DIDL-Lite
object and is illustrated in :ref:`the figure below <figure-inheritance>`. The
black lines are the lines of inheritance, going from left to right.

All data structures are subclasses of the abstract `Didl Object item <soco.data_structures.DidlObject>` class. You should never need to instantiate this directly. The subclasses are divided into :py:class:`Containers <soco.data_structures.DidlContainer>` and :py:class:`Items <soco.data_structures.DidlObject>`. In general, :py:class:`Containers <soco.data_structures.DidlContainer>` are things, like playlists, which are intended to contain other items.

At the bottom of the class hierarchy are 10 types of :py:class:`DIDL items <.DidlObject>`. On each of these classes, relevant metadata items
are available as attributes (though they may be implemented as properties).
Each has a :py:attr:`title <.DidlObject.title>`, a :py:attr:`URI <.DidlObject.uri>`, an :py:attr:`item id <.DidlObject.item_id>` and
a :py:attr:`UPnP class <.DidlObject.item_class>`. Some have other
attributes. For example, :py:class:`.DidlMusicTrack` and :py:class:`.DidlMusicAlbum` have
some extra fields such as :py:attr:`album <.DidlMusicTrack.album>`,
:py:attr:`album_art_uri <.DidlMusicTrack.album_art_uri>` and :py:attr:`creator <.DidlMusicTrack.creator>`.

One of the more important attributes which each class has is
:py:attr:`didl_metadata <.DidlObject.didl_metadata>`. It is used to
produce the metadata that is sent to the SonosÂ® units in the form of XML. This
metadata is created in an almost identical way for each class, which is why it
is implemented in :py:class:`.DidlObject`. It uses the URI, the UPnP
class and the title that the items are instantiated with, along with the two
class variables ``parent_id`` and ``_translation``.
