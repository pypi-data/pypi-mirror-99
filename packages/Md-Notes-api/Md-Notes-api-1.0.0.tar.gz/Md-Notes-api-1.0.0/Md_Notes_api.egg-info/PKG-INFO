Description: # Getting Started with MdNotes
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Introduction
        
        API for Markdown Notes app.
        
        ### Install the Package
        
        The package is compatible with Python versions `2 >=2.7.9` and `3 >=3.4`.
        Install the package from PyPi using the following pip command:
        
        ```python
        pip install Md-Notes-api==1.0.0
        ```
        
        You can also view the package at:
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Md-Notes-api
        
        ### Initialize the API Client
        
        The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:
        
        | Parameter | Type | Description |
        |  --- | --- | --- |
        | `o_auth_client_id` | `string` | OAuth 2 Client ID |
        | `o_auth_redirect_uri` | `string` | OAuth 2 Redirection endpoint or Callback Uri |
        | `environment` | Environment | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.PRODUCTION`** |
        | `timeout` | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
        | `max_retries` | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 3** |
        | `backoff_factor` | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 0** |
        
        The API client can be initialized as follows:
        
        ```python
        from mdnotes.mdnotes_client import MdnotesClient
        from mdnotes.configuration import Environment
        
        client = MdnotesClient(
            o_auth_client_id='OAuthClientId',
            o_auth_redirect_uri='OAuthRedirectUri',
            environment = Environment.PRODUCTION,)
        ```
        
        You must now authorize the client.
        
        ### Authorization
        
        Your application must obtain user authorization before it can execute an endpoint call. The SDK uses *OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant* to obtain a user's consent to perform an API request on user's behalf.
        
        This process requires the presence of a client-side JavaScript code on the redirect URI page to receive the *access token* after the consent step is completed.
        
        #### 1- Obtain user consent
        
        To obtain user's consent, you must redirect the user to the authorization page. The `get_authorization_url()` method creates the URL to the authorization page.
        
        ```python
        auth_url = client.auth.get_authorization_url()
        ```
        
        #### 2- Handle the OAuth server response
        
        Once the user responds to the consent request, the OAuth 2.0 server responds to your application's access request by redirecting the user to the redirect URI specified set in `Configuration`.
        
        The redirect URI will receive the *access token* as the `token` argument in the URL fragment.
        
        ```
        https://example.com/oauth/callback#token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        ```
        
        The access token must be extracted by the client-side JavaScript code. The access token can be used to authorize any further endpoint calls by the JavaScript code.
