## [Unreleased]

## 1.3.0 (200-12-27)

Thanks to Istvan Albert, it is now possible to use language keywords and
builtins as option/flag names. Some broken links were fixed and the
documentation has been moved to https://plac.readthedocs.io,
while the CI framework has changed from Travis to GitHub actions.

##  1.2.0 (2020-06-05)

Added dedenting of usage docstrings, as requested by Istvan Albert.
Added new decorators `plac.pos`, `plac.opt`, `plac.flg` and an example
using them in a section "For the impatient".
Added tests on travis for Python 3.8.

##  1.1.3 (2018-10-27)

Fixed some issues with kwargs parsing, docstring formatting and empty
string defaults reported by the user https://github.com/isaacto. Changed
the testing framework on travis from nosetest to pytest. Ported the
documentation to sphinx.

## 1.1.0 (2018-07-28)

Extended the recognition of default types to date and datetime in ISO
format. Fixed a bug when running plac scripts from Jupyter notebooks,
signaled by https://github.com/ursachi and https://github.com/rkpatel33.
Moreover, at user request, removed a Python 3.7 deprecation warning,
added a LICENSE.txt file and a Quickstart section to the README. plac
is tested on Travis for Python 2.7 and 3.4+ but it should work also
for all the other 3.X releases.

## 1.0.0 (2018-08-03)

New feature, requested by John Didion: if the type of an argument is not
specified but there is a default value, it is inferred from it. This is
experimental and works only for Python literal types.
Fixed a bug caused by arguments with default None in newer versions of argparse.
Added a `gh-pages` branch with the documentation, as suggested by Ryan Gonzalez.
Extended the Travis testing to Python 3.6. Python 2.6 still works but it is
untested and therefore deprecated.

## 0.9.6  (2016-07-09)

Solved an issue with non-ASCII characters; now any UTF-8 character
can go in the help message. Added support for `--version` in plac.call.
Modernized the changelog http://keepachangelog.com/

Removed an usage of `print >>` that was breaking Python 3, signaled

Removed use_2to3 in setup.py which was breaking Python 2, signaled
by Quentin Pradet

## 0.9.2 (2016-06-07)

Moved the repository from GoogleCode to GitHub. Included the doc fixes

Enabled Travis builds for Python 2.6 and 2.7

## 0.9.1 (2012-04-23)

with tuple defaults and fixed the display of the help command; specified
which features are experimental and which features are fully supported
