# -------------------------- Environment definitions --------------------------
#
# Basic config
# ============
#
# The minimal required definition is to define an Environment and at least one API.
#
# Note: Yaml allows spaces in keys if the key is surrounded by single or
#       double quotes.
#
# Example (add two environments's 'production' & 'lab'):
#
# The 'apis' parameter defines which apis are available in this environment.
# Note: this is the 'defaults' key for an InheritableCfgItem.
# An API is defined as 'API Family: API Key'
#   ---
#   production:
#     apis:
#       first_api: api_1
#   lab:
#     apis:
#       first_api: api_1
#       second_api: api_2
#   ...
#
#
# Additional Parameters
# =====================
#
# Hiding an Environment
# ---------------------
# Setting an Environments 'hidden' parameter will stop it being presented on the
# Environment listing.  This is useful for Environment definitions that are only
# intended as bases for other Environments.
#
# Example (define a hidden Environment):
#
#   ---
#   env_base:
#     hidden: true
#     apis:
#       first_api: api_1
#   ...
#
#
# Inheriting Environments
# -----------------------
# The 'inherits' parameter allows one Environment to inherit the configuration
# of another Environment.
#
# Example (Repeat first example using inheritance):
#
#   ---
#   env_base:
#     hidden: true
#     apis:
#       first_api: api_1
#
#   production:
#     inherits: "env_base"
#
#   lab:
#     inherits: "env_base"
#     apis:
#       second_api: api_2
#   ...
#
#
# Setting an environments 'location'
# ----------------------------------
#
# You can set an environments location with the 'location' key.
# The location could be anything you chose: country, state, continent, etc.
#
# Example (define an Environment with a location):
#
#   ---
#   env_base:
#     location: "GBR"
#     apis:
#       first_api: api_1
#   ...
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

production:
  location: "somewhere"
  apis:
    family_a: "api_1"
    family_b: "api_2"

lab:
  location: "nowhere"
  apis:
    family_a: "api_1"
    family_b: "api_3"
