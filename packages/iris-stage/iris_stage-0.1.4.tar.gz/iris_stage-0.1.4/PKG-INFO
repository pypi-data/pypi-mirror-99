        ## Quickstart
        Save AWS certs and IRIS machine certs to your home directory. See [.aws guide](.aws/README.md) and [.secrets guide](.secrets/README.md) for instructions.
        
        Install the latest `iris-stage` package:
        ```bash
        python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
        ...
        python3 -m pip install --no-cache iris-stage
        ```
        Launch the staging client:
        ```bash
        stage
        ```
        Halt the client:
        ```bash
        unstage
        ```
        
        ## Iris Stage Client Deployment
        The recommended deployment method for the iris staging client is hosted on the [Incuvers/automation](https://github.com/Incuvers/automation) repository using ansible. Follow the setup instructions and proceed with the iris staging client deployment.
        
        ## Client Requirements
        This client is designed to be run on an iris production machine. All the hardware and peripherals should be mounted and ready for integration testing.
        
        ### AWS Services
        The AWS Python SDK `boto3` requires AWS user tokens and region information. To avoid passing these tokens at runtime and increasing the complexity of the build process I have required that the AWS credentials and configuration are bound to the staging client. Therefore these credentials will exist in the `$HOME` directory as described [here](.aws/README.md)
        
        ### IRIS Machine Credentials
        The IRIS snap requires production grade machine credentials. I have required that the machine credentials are bound to the staging client in the `$HOME` directory as described [here](.secrets/README.md). These credentials must be production grade as the snap is built pointing to our production api.
