"""
Adapations of pickle to make it more robust to changes in pickled objects.

Provides robustness by not serializing the methods of the target object, only
its __dict__. Deserialization involves: (a) create a default instantiation
of the object and (b) re-assigning its __dict__.

Objects for which this behavior is desired must inherit RPickler and
override the class method RPicklerConstructor(cls) as appropriate to
so that the method returns a default instance of the class.
