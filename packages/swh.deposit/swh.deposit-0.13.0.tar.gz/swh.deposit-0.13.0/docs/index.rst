Software Heritage - Deposit
===========================

`SWORD v2`_ based deposit of software source code artifacts and metadata to the
Software Heritage (SWH) Archive.

Description
-----------

Most of the software source code artifacts present in the SWH Archive are
gathered by the mean of :term:`loader <loader>` workers run by the SWH project
from sourve code origins identified by :term:`lister <lister>` workers. This is
a pull mechanism: it's the responsibility of the SWH project to gather and
collect source code artifacts that way.

Alternatively, SWH allows its partners to push source code
artifacts and metadata directly into the Archive with a push-based mechanism.
By using this possibility different actors, holding software artifacts or
metadata, can preserve their assets without having to pass through an
intermediate collaborative development platform, which is already harvested by
SWH (e.g GitHub, Gitlab, etc.).

This mechanism is the `deposit`.

The main idea is the deposit is an authenticated access to an API allowing the
user to provide source code artifacts -- with metadata -- to be ingested in the
SWH Archive. The result of that is a :ref:`SWHID
<persistent-identifiers>` that can be used to uniquely and persistently
identify that very piece of source code.

This unique identifier can then be used to `reference the source code
<https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02446202>`_ (e.g. in a `scientific paper
<https://www.softwareheritage.org/2020/05/26/citing-software-with-style/>`_)
and retrieve it using the :ref:`vault <swh-vault>` feature of the SWH Archive
platform.

The differences between a piece of code uploaded using the deposit rather than
simply asking SWH to archive a repository using the `save code now
<https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/>`_ feature are:

- a deposited artifact is provided from one of the SWH partners which is
  regarded as a trusted authority,
- a deposited artifact requires metadata properties describing the source code
  artifact,
- a deposited artifact has a codemeta_ metadata entry attached to it,
- a deposited artifact has the same visibility on the SWH Archive than a
  collected repository,
- a deposited artifacts can be searched with its provided url property on the
  SWH Archive,
- the deposit API uses the `SWORD v2`_ API, thus requires some tooling to send
  deposits to SWH. These tools are provided with this repository.


See the :ref:`user-manual` page for more details on how to use the deposit
client command line tools to push a deposit in the SWH Archive.

See the :ref:`swh-api-specifications` reference pages of the SWORDv2 API
implementation in `swh.deposit` if you want to do upload deposits using HTTP
requests.

Read the :ref:`metadata` chapter to get more details on what metadata are
supported when doing a deposit.

See :ref:`swh-deposit-dev` if you want to hack the code of the `swh.deposit`
module.

See :ref:`swh-deposit-deployment` if you want to deploy your own copy of the
`swh.deposit` stack.
