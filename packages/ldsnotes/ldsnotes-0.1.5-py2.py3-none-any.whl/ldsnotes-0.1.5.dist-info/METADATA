Unofficial Python API to interact with your annotations from churchofjesuschrist.org. 
I reverse engineered a bit of the API to download content/user notes from churchofjesuschrist.org.
Currently can only download notes, working on uploading next.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://ldsnotes.readthedocs.io.


Roadmap
--------

* Update Content/Annotation classes to inherit from addict.Dict. Should make upload easier later.
* 2-way sync.

Done
-----

* Make tests (and setup CI with travis) using dummy account/notes. 

Handling Highlights
--------------------

The way churchofjesuschrist.org handles where highlights are is a bit difficult to reverse engineer. They save where your highlight is
by counting words - both from the start, and from the end. The difficult part is figuring out what they consider a "word". For example,
a footnote/reference counts as a word, *and a comma after a word with a footnote also counts as one*. This makes things very case by case
to get things right. If you have a problem with a highlight being a few words off, please open an issue with your where your highlight is at.

TL;DR Highlights are hard, open issue if yours are off.
