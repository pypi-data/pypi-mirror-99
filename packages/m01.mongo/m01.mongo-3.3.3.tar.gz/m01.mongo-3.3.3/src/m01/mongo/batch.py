    """Returns batched mongo cursor, current page, total items and page size.
    
    Note: this method will not return loaded IMongoItems. If you need to
    load the given mongo data you can simply iterate the given cursor and
    call doLoad(data). The doLoad method also takes care of all the cached
    items. But take care, since mongo returns removed items and doesn't
    know about new added items till a transaction commits, this method
    could return bad items. And if you like to skip removed items from
    the curser by yourself, the page and pages counter could get messed up.
    If you like to bypass this troubles, I highly recommend only call
    doLoad based on cursor data if you didn't add or remove items from a
    container in the same transaction.
    (response.redirect or transaction.commit are your friends)

    Note: the page can get recalculated if the page position doesn't fit
    into the batch. This means the page in the reult can be different as
    the given page input. This is usefull if we use a larger page number
    as we realy have, e.g. after remove an item.

    Note: this method will call doBatchDataFilter which could enhance
    the given query specification

    Note: take care, this method will ignore cached (removed, added) items
    till we commit the transaction. You can eighter commit the transaction
    or use a response redirect in your request before using this method
    after remove or add items.
