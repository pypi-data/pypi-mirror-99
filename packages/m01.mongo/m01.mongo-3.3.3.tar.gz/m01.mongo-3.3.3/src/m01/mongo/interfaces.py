    IMPORTANT:
    we use the order latitude, longitude and (NOT lon, lat) like described in

    A more detailed description about the lon/lat order thema:

    looking at the Geographic Coordinate System, you'll notice that longitude
    counts left to right, while latitude counts bottom to top. Translating that
    into x/y this would mean the Longitude/Latitude approach is the only one
    that makes sense logically.

    In english, coordinates are usually referred to as latitude/longitude in a
    term. This is due to 2 reasons: a precedents o in the alphabet and in
    Navigation, in the days of sextants Latitude was easier, and more exactly
    determined, so that was the first thing to determine/write down.

    From OGC Specs, lon/lat is the correct way to interpret them. You can
    easily see that from how those that where participants in creating the
    Specs (Oracle/Informix/ESRI/IBM) implemented them, and those that did
    their own stuff (MS/Google).

    Note: The GeoLocation is registered with zope.Public permission. This is
    fine for ost use case since you will protect the property which is storing
    such a GeoLocation item. There is no need to explicit protect the lon/lat
    attributes. Just make sure npbody with the correct permission can access
    the GeoLocation item itself.
