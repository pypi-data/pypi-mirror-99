This package provides a mongodb object mapper framework including zope
transaction support based on some core zope component libraries. This package
can get used with or without zope.persistent and as a full replacement for the
ZODB. The package is not heavy based on zope itself and can get used in any
python project which requires a bridge from mongodb to python object.
