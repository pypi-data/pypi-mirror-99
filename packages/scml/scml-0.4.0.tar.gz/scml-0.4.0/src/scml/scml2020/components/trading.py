        - `Requires` section describes any requirements from the agent using this component. It defines a set of methods
          or properties/data-members that must exist in the agent that uses this component. These requirement are
          usually implemented as abstract methods in the component
        - `Abstract` section describes abstract methods that MUST be implemented by any descendant of this component.
        - `Hooks Into` section describes the methods this component overrides calling `super` () which allows other
          components to hook into the same method (by overriding it). Usually callbacks starting with `on_` are
          hooked into this way.

          disallowing any other components after it in the MRO to call this method. Usually methods that do some
          action (i.e. not starting with `on_`) are overridden this way.
