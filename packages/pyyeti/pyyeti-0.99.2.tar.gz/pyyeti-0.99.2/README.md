# pyYeti

pyYeti has tools mostly related to structural dynamics:


* Solve matrix equations of motion in the time and frequency domains
* Shock response spectrum (SRS)
* Fatigue damage equivalent power spectral densities (PSD)
* Hurty-Craig-Bampton model checks
* Coupled loads analysis tools
* Statistics tools for computing k-factors (for tolerance bounds and intervals) and for order statistics
* A data-cursor for interacting with 2D x-y plots
* Eigensystem Realization Algorithm
* Force limiting analysis tools
* Read/write Nastran output4 (.op4) files
* Limited capability to read Nastran output2 (.op2) files
* Rainflow cycle counting
* Resample data with the Lanczos method
* A "vectorized" writing module
* Eigensolution with the subspace iteration method
* Tools for working with the "nas2cam" Nastran DMAP
* Other miscellaneous tools


## Installation

pyYeti runs on Python 3.6 or later. The dependencies are NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, pandas and setuptools. These are all conveniently provided
by the Anaconda Python distribution:
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.

You can install pyYeti via `pip`:

    pip install pyyeti

I generally prefer to install from source, doing something like this:

    git clone https://github.com/twmacro/pyyeti.git
    cd pyyeti
    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/.python

Note that for the C version of the rainflow cycle counter, you also
need a C compiler installed.


## Documentation

pyYeti documentation is here:

   http://pyyeti.readthedocs.org/


## Tutorials

The documentation contains several tutorials in the documentation.
These are also available (in their original form) as Jupyter
notebooks:

## Contributing to pyYeti

Contributions are much appreciated. Bug reports, documentation
updates, feature requests, and code enhancements are all great
ways to contribute.
