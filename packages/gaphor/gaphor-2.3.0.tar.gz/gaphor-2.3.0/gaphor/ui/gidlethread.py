"""This module contains some helpers that can be used to execute generator
functions in the GLib main loop.

This module provided the following classes:
GIdleThread - Thread like behavior for generators in a main loop
Queue - A simple queue implementation suitable for use with GIdleThread

Exceptions:
QueueEmpty - raised when one tried to get a value of an empty queue
QueueFull - raised when the queue reaches it's max size and the oldest item
            may not be disposed.

class GIdleThread:
    """This is a pseudo-"thread" for use with the GTK+ main loop.

    This class does act a bit like a thread, all code is executed in
    the callers thread though. The provided function should be a generator
    (or iterator).

    It can be started with start(). While the "thread" is running is_alive()
    can be called to see if it's alive. wait([timeout]) will wait till the
    generator is finished, or timeout seconds.

    If an exception is raised from within the generator, it is stored in
    the exc_info property. Execution of the generator is finished. The
    exc_info property contains a tuple (exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback),
    see sys.exc_info() for details.

    Note that this routine runs in the current thread, so there is no need
    for nasty locking schemes.

    Example (runs a counter through the GLib main loop routine):
    >>> def counter(max):
    ...     for x in range(max):
    ...         yield x
    >>> t = GIdleThread(counter(123))
    >>> id = t.start()
    >>> main = GLib.main_context_default()
    >>> t.is_alive()
    True
    >>> main.iteration(False)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    True
