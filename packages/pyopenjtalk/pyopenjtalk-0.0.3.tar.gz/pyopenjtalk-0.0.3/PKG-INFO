        **THIS IS ALPHA VERSION!**
        
        A python wrapper for [OpenJTalk](http://open-jtalk.sp.nitech.ac.jp/). Note that this is built on top of a [modified version of OpenJTalk](https://github.com/r9y9/open_jtalk).
        
        It's currently limited for text processing frontend functionality.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package is based on cython and built on top of the shared library of the OpenJTalk. Please have a look at the `travis.yml` and see how the shared library is installed. After you have installed the OpenJTalk shared library, then the installation of the package is just as follows:
        
        ```
        pip install pyopenjtalk
        ```
        
        ## Quick demo
        
        ```py
        In [1]: import pyopenjtalk
        
        In [2]: pyopenjtalk.g2p("こんにちは")
        Out[2]: 'k o N n i ch i w a'
        
        In [3]: pyopenjtalk.g2p("こんにちは", kana=True)
        Out[3]: 'コンニチワ'
