Release versioning
****************************************************************************

The versions of Dragonfly releases are strongly inspired by the
semantic versioning concept, as promoted by Tom Preston-Werner and
documented at `semver.org`_.

Each version string has the format "major.minor.patch", where each part
has the following meaning:

 - *Major* -- version when you make incompatible API changes.
 - *Minor* -- version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
   manner.
 - *Patch* -- version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Please see `semver.org`_ for guidelines on version incrementation and other
topics.
