Description: # krules-core
        
        This is the python core package of KRules.
        
        KRules is a rules engine primarily intended to run on Kubernetes. 
        However the core can be easily used even in different contexts. 
        In addition to the core part, you need at least one subject implementation.
        
        KRules is a project in progress and we are working hard on a first widely usable version.
        
        Exhaustive documentation has not yet been released.
        
        If you are interested in getting an idea of the project you can meanwhile take a look at the [overview](https://github.com/airspot-dev/krules-doc/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md) document in which the general concepts are explained.
