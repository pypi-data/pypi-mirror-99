`cg` stands for _Clinical Genomics_; a clinical sequencing platform under [SciLifeLab][scilife]

This is our main package for interacting with data and samples that flow through our pipeline. We rely on a set of specialized "apps" to deal with a lot of complexity like:

- [Trailblazer][trailblazer]: Python wrapper around [MIP][mip], a rare disease genomics pipeline
- [Housekeeper][housekeeper]: storage, retrieval, and archival of files
- [Genotype][genotype]: managing genotypes for detecting sample mix-ups

In this context, `cg` provides the interface between these tools to facilitate automation and other necessary cross-talk. It also exposes some APIs:

- HTTP REST for powering the web portal: [clinical.scilifelab.se][portal]
- CLI for interactions on the command line

## Installation

Cg written in Python 3.6+ and is available on the [Python Package Index][pypi] (PyPI).

```bash
pip install cg
```

If you would like to install the latest development version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/cg
cd cg
```
To install CG either use pipenv (as described in contributing) and run
```
pipenv install -e .
```

or (without pipenv)

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt --editable .
```

Files will be blacked automatically with each push to github. If you would like to automatically [Black][black] format your commits on your local machince:

```
pre-commit install
```
