About
============

The prototype analysis facility provides services for “low latency columnar analysis”, enabling rapid processing of data in a column-wise fashion. These services, based on Dask and Jupyter notebooks, aim to dramatically lower time for analysis and provide an easily-scalable and user-friendly computational environment that will simplify, facilitate, and accelerate the delivery of HEP results. The facility is built on top of a Kubernetes cluster and integrates dedicated resources with resources allocated via fairshare through the local HTCondor system. In addition to the user-facing interfaces such as Dask, the facility also manages access control through single-sign-on and authentication & authorization for data access. The notebooks in this repository and ![Coffea-casa tutorials](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea-casa-tutorials) include simple HEP analysis examples, managed interactively in a Jupyter notebook and scheduled on Dask workers and accessing both public and protected data.


Image tagging and "continuous building"
============

This repository uses GitHub Actions to build images, run tests, and push images to DockerHub.

1. Tags pushed to GitHub represent "production" releases with corresponding tags on dockerhub `coffeateam/coffea-casa:x.x.x` and `coffeateam/coffea-casa-analysis:x.x.x`. The latest tag also corresponds to the most recent GitHub tag.
