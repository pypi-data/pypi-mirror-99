The Crazyflie PC client enables flashing and controlling the Crazyflie.
It implements the user interface and high-level control (for example gamepad handling).
The communication with Crazyflie and the implementation of the CRTP protocol to control the Crazyflie is handled by the [cflib](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python) project.
