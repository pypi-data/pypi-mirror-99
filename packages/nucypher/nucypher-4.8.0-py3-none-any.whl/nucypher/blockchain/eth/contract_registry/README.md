# Registries of NuCypher Networks

This directory contains an authoritative source of contract registries for several NuCypher networks.
These registries comprise the official addresses and ABIs for the networks' smart contracts.


## Current networks

* `mainnet`: The main NuCypher Network, offering cryptographic runtimes for secrets management and dynamic access control ðŸš€
	* Running on Ethereum Mainnet
	* Main contract addresses: 
		* [**NuCypherToken**](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4fE83213D56308330EC302a8BD641f1d0113A4Cc): `0x4fE83213D56308330EC302a8BD641f1d0113A4Cc`
		* [**StakingEscrow (Dispatcher)**](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbD3C0C794F40c4f993B03F65343aCC6fcfCb2e2): `0xbbD3C0C794F40c4f993B03F65343aCC6fcfCb2e2`

* `lynx`: Public Long-Term Support testnet, intended as a stable playground for network users (e.g., Alices wishing to create sharing policies). Running on Ethereum Goerli testnet. 
* `ibex`: Public testnet, intended as a playground for stakers & node operators (e.g., learning how to create and manage stakes, setting up a node), as well as for internal development purposes. Running on Ethereun Rinkeby testnet.

## Historical networks

The following is a list of networks that we used at some point in the past and that are currently deprecated:

* `miranda`: Our first decentralized testnet.
* `frances`: Our second testnet. Only for development purposes.
* `cassandra`: Incentivized Testnet, supporting our 'Come and Stake It' initiative.
* `gemini`: New version of Incentivized Testnet, supporting Phase 4 of 'Come and Stake It'.
