Description: Python Lottie
        =============
        
        A Python framework to work with Lottie files and Telegram animated stickers.
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        This section describes some common things you might want to do without having
        to read the whole README
        
        ### Installation
        
            pip install lottie
        
        ### Converting into images
        
        This package provide the script `lottie_convert.py`, it's precise location
        depends on how you installed python-lottie.
        
        For PNG, GIF, and Webp you have to install `cairosvg` and `pillow`.
        
        To render a still image:
        
            lottie_convert.py input_file.json output_file.png --frame 30
        
        
        To render an animated image (GIF or WebP):
        
            lottie_convert.py input_file.json output_file.webp
        
        
        A list of supported formats is described in the section "Supported Formats" below.
        
        
        ### Turning GIF and such into animations
        
        The lottie format is for vector graphics, this means converting raster images
        usually doesn't work too well.
        
        That said, python-lottie does support a few different algorithms to import
        raster images, the process is a bit slow for larger images but use it with caution.
        
        To use the potrace vectorization library, install the extras tagged as "trace".
        
        Once set up, just invoke `lottie_convert.py` using the vectorization algorithm
        
            lottie_convert.py input_file.gif output_file.json --bmp-mode trace
        
        For pixel art, you can use the `pizel` algorithm, which doesn't require potrace
        
            lottie_convert.py input_file.gif output_file.json --bmp-mode pixel
        
        If you are ok with keeping raster images as such, you can use the default mode
        
            lottie_convert.py input_file.gif output_file.json
        
        ### Converting Telegram animated stickers (tgs)
        
        This format is natively supported by python lottie, but telegram doesn't
        support all of the features supported by lottie
        (see the section labeled "Supported After Effects Features" for details).
        
        When converting from tgs, nothing special is needed as it's handled as a lottie animation.
        
            lottie_convert.py AnimatedSticker.tgs output_file.webp
        
        But when converting into animated stickers, you might end up with a file that
        Telegram doesn't recognize. To help with this, by default `lottie_convert.py`
        will scale the animation to be the right size and framerate.
        It will also print out any warnings related to unsupported features.
        Everything else works like any other conversion:
        
            lottie_convert.py input_file.json output_file.tgs
        
        If you want to see the same warnings for an existing tgs file use `tgs_check.py`
        
            tgs_check.py AnimatedSticker.tgs
        
        
        ### Creating animations from scratch
        
        See the examples at https://mattbas.gitlab.io/python-lottie/examples.html
        and read the available lottie objects at https://mattbas.gitlab.io/python-lottie/group__Lottie.html#details
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Here is a list of features of the lottie python framework:
        
        * Loading compressed TGS and uncompressed lottie JSON
        * Manipulation of lottie objects
        * Simple animation presets (eg: shake, linear bounce)
        * Bezier path animations (eg: follow path, making paths appear and disappear)
        * Wave distortion animation (eg: for flags)
        * Pseudo-3D rotations
        * Animation easing functions
        * Inverse Kinematic solver
        * Pretty printing and comparison of lottie files

        Scripts
        -------
        
        python-lottie provides several scripts to convert or manage lottie animations.
        For full documentation see https://mattbas.gitlab.io/python-lottie/scripts.html
        
        The main one is `lottie_convert.py`, which can be used to convert between the supported formats.
        
        There is also the script `lottie_gui.py` which provides a graphical interface for lottie playback.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ### Downloads
        
        The packages for the various applications listed below can be downloaded from here:
        
        * [Releases](https://gitlab.com/mattbas/python-lottie/-/releases)
        * [Development Snapshot](https://mattbas.gitlab.io/python-lottie/downloads.html)
        
        
        ### Synfig
        
        There's a Synfig studio plugin to export telegram stickers.
        To install, just copy (or symlink) ./addons/synfig/pylot-exporter
        into the synfig plugin directory.
        You might have to copy ./lib/lottie in there as well.
        
        
        ### Inkscape
        
        There are some import/export extensions for inkscape.
        
        Just copy (or symlink) the files under ./addons/inkscape to the inkscape extension
        directory.
        On my system that's ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/ but you can double check from
        Inkscape: Edit > Preferences... > System > User extensions
        
        Note that the extensions require Python 3.
        If they are run with a python 2 interpreter, they will try to run themselves using `python3`.
        
        They also need the lottie framework to be in the python path, otherwise you can manually
        set the path on the import/export dialogues.
        
        See also https://inkscape.org/~mattia.basaglia/%E2%98%85tgslottie-importexport
        
        
        ### Blender
        
        There are some export addons for blender.
        
        Copy (or symlink) the files under ./addons/blender to the Blender extension
        directory.
        
        On my system that's ~/.config/blender/2.80/scripts/addons/ you can check available
        paths through the Blender Python console:
        
            import addon_utils; print(addon_utils.paths())
        
        You can also install the addon from Blender using the zipfile created by `make`.
        
        
        ### Pip
        
        You can install from pypi:
        
            pip install lottie
        
        from git:
        
            pip install git+https://gitlab.com/mattbas/python-lottie.git@master
        
        for the source directory:
        
            pip install /path/to/the/sources # this is the path where setup.py is located
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 3.
        
        
        ### Optional Requirements
        
        In order to provide lean installations, this framework doesn't have dependencies
        for its core functionality.
        
        To add support for extra formats or advanced functionality, you can install
        additional packages.
        
        These requirements are declared as extra in the Pypi package,
        follows a table listing dependencies and features
        
        
        | Packages                                      | Extra | Feature                                                   |
        |-----------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | `pillow`                                      | images| To load image assets                                      |
        | `cairosvg`                                    | PNG   | To export PNG / PDF / PS                                  |
        | `cairosvg`, `pillow`                          | GIF   | To export GIF and animated WebP                           |
        | `fonttools`                                   | text  | To render text as shapes                                  |
        | `grapheme`                                    | emoji | Adding emoji support to text rendering                    |
        | `cairosvg`, `numpy`, Python OpenCV 2          | video | To export video                                           |
        | `pillow`, `pypotrace>=0.2`, `numpy`, `scipy`  | trace | To convert raster images into vectors                     |
        | `QScintilla`                                  | GUI   | Grafical user interface utilities                         |
        | `coverage`                                    |       | To show unit test coverage, used optionally by `test.sh`  |
        
        
        If intalling from pip, you can install optional requirements like so:
        
            pip install lottie[GIF]
        
        The above example will ensure `cairosvg` and `pillow` are installed.
        For more details see https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#examples.
        
        For convenience, an additional extra requirements is defined,
        so you can install all dependencies at once:
        
            pip install lottie[all]
        
        If you are using python-lottie from source you can run
        
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Which will install all the requirements (except for pypotrace, as that package has some issues)
        
        
        Telegram Animated Stickers
        --------------------------
        
        I had to reverse engineer the format because Telegram couldn't be bothered
        providing the specs.
        
        A TGS file is a gzip compressed JSON, the JSON data is described here:
        https://mattbas.gitlab.io/python-lottie/group__Lottie.html#lottie_json
        
        ### Making your own exporters converters
        
        #### Lottie format
        
        If you can get the source image into lottie format, that's 90% of the work done.
        
        I've created Python classes based the format schema and after effects documentation, which
        output the correct json. Eg:
        
            foo = lottie.Animation()
            # ...
            json.dump(foo.to_dict(), output_file)
        
        I'm also creating a proper documentation for the format, see:
        https://mattbas.gitlab.io/tgs/group__Lottie.html#details
        
        #### TGS changes
        
        Nothing major, just ensure the root JSON object has `tgs: 1`
        
        #### Gzipping
        
        The tgs file is the JSON described above compressed into a gzip,
        and renamed to .tgs
