Introduction
------------

Photutils contains functions for:

* performing aperture photometry

* performing PSF-fitting photometry

* detecting and extracting point-like sources (e.g., stars) in
  astronomical images

* detecting and extracting extended sources using image segmentation
  in astronomical images

* centroiding sources

* estimating the background and background RMS in astronomical images

* building an effective Point Spread Function (ePSF)

* matching PSF kernels

* estimating morphological parameters of detected sources
