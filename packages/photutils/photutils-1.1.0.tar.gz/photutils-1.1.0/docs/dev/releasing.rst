****************************
Package Release Instructions
****************************

This document outlines the steps for releasing Photutils to PyPI. This
process currently requires admin-level access to the Photutils GitHub
repository, as it relies on the ability to commit to main directly. It
also requires a PyPI account with admin-level access for Photutils.

These instructions assume the name of the git remote for the repo is
called ``upstream``.

#. Check out the branch that you are going to release. This will usually
   be the ``main`` branch, unless you are making a bugfix release.

   For a bugfix release, check out the ``A.B.x`` branch. Use ``git
   cherry-pick <hash>`` (or ``git cherry-pick -m1 <hash>`` for merge
   commits) to backport fixes to the bugfix branch. Also, be sure to
   push all changes to the upstream repo so that CI can run on the
   bugfix branch.

#. Ensure that CI tests are passing for the branch you are going to
   release. Also, ensure that Read the Docs builds are passing.

#. Locally run the tests using ``tox`` to thoroughly test the code in
   isolated environments::

        tox -e test-alldeps -- --remote-data=any
        tox -e build_docs
        tox -e linkcheck

#. Update the ``CHANGES.rst`` file to make sure that all the changes are
   listed and update the release date, which should currently be set to
   ``unreleased``, to the current date in ``yyyy-mm-dd`` format. Then
   commit the changes::

        git add CHANGES.rst
        git commit -m'Finalizing changelog for version <X.Y.Z>'

#. Remove any untracked files (WARNING: this will permanently remove any
   files that have not been previously committed, so make sure that you
   don't need to keep any of these files)::

        git clean -dfx

#. Make sure the source distribution doesn't inherit limited permissions
   from your default umask::

        umask 0022
        chmod -R a+Xr .

#. Update the package version number to the version youâ€™re about to
   release by creating an annotated git tag (optionally signing with the
   ``-s`` option)::

        git tag -a <X.Y.Z> -m'<X.Y.Z>'
        git show <X.Y.Z>  # show the tag
        git tag  # show all tags

#. Check out the release commit::

        git checkout <X.Y.Z>

#. Generate the source distribution tar file by first making sure the
   `build <https://pypi.org/project/build/>`_ package is installed and
   up to date::

        pip install build --upgrade

   then creating the source distribution with::

        python -m build --sdist .

#. Run tests on the generated source distribution by going inside the
   ``dist`` directory, expanding the tar file, going inside the expanded
   directory, and running the tests with::

        cd dist
        tar xvfz <file>.tar.gz
        cd <file>
        tox -e test-alldeps -- --remote-data=any
        tox -e build_docs

   Optionally, install and test the source distribution in a virtual
   environment::

        <install and activate virtual environment>
        pip install -e '.[all,test]'
        pytest --remote-data=any

   or::

        <install and activate virtual environment>
        pip install '../<file>.tar.gz[all,test]'
        cd <any-directory-outside-of-photutils-source>
        python
        >>> import photutils
        >>> photutils.__version__
        >>> photutils.test(remote_data=True)

#. Go back to the package root directory and remove the generated files
   with::

        git clean -dfx

#. Generate the source distribution and upload it to PyPI::

        python -m build --sdist .
        twine check dist/*
        twine upload dist/*

   Check that the entry on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/photutils/) is
   correct, and that the tarfile is present.

#. Go back to the main branch::

    git checkout main

#. Push the released tag to the upstream repo::

        git push upstream <X.Y.Z>

#. Update ``CHANGES.rst``. After releasing a minor (bugfix) version,
   update its release date. After releasing a major version, add a new
   section to ``CHANGES.rst`` for the next ``x.y.z`` version, with a
   single entry ``No changes yet``, e.g.,::

       x.y.z (unreleased)
       ------------------

       - No changes yet

   Then commit the changes and push to the upstream repo::

        git add CHANGES.rst
        git commit -m'Add version <x.y.z> to the changelog'
        git push upstream main

#. After releasing a major version, tag this new commit with the
   development version of the next major version and push the tag to
   the upstream repo. This is needed if the latest package release is
   the first bugfix release tagged on a bugfix branch (not the main
   branch)::

        git tag -a <x.y.z.dev> -m'<x.y.z.dev>'
        git push upstream <x.y.z.dev>

#. Create a GitHub Release
   (https://github.com/astropy/photutils/releases) by clicking on
   "Draft a new release", select the tag of the released version, add
   a release title with the released version, and add the following
   description::

        See the [changelog](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html) for release notes.

   Then click "Publish release". This step will trigger an automatic
   update of the package on Zenodo (see below).

#. Close the GitHub Milestone
   (https://github.com/astropy/photutils/milestones) for the released
   version and, if needed, open a new Milestone for the next release.

#. Go to Read the Docs
   (https://readthedocs.org/projects/photutils/versions/) and check that
   the "stable" docs correspond to the new released version. Deactivate
   any older released versions (i.e., uncheck "Active").

#. Check that Zenodo is updated with the released version
   (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596036). Zenodo is already configured
   to automatically update with a new published GitHub Release (see
   above).

#. After the release, the conda-forge bot (``regro-cf-autotick-bot``)
   will automatically create a pull request on
   https://github.com/conda-forge/photutils-feedstock. The ``meta.yaml``
   recipe may need to be edited with updated dependencies. Modify (if
   necessary), review, and merge the PR to create the conda-forge
   package (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/photutils). The Astropy
   conda channel (https://anaconda.org/astropy/photutils) will
   automatically mirror the package from conda-forge.

#. Build wheels and upload them to PyPI. The
   Photutils wheels are currently built using
   https://github.com/larrybradley/photutils-wheel-forge. Once the
   wheels have been built, they are uploaded as artifacts in Azure
   Pipelines. Download the wheels from Azure Pipelines and upload them
   to PyPI::

        python get_wheels.py
        twine upload wheelhouse/*.whl
