        Enter your query in the text field. Make sure that attributes mentioned in the query
        are existent in the listed attributes underneath the input field
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        (Optional) Select features. GBD will resolve the results against these features
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Each database has a set of features. You can download a database by clicking
        <b-icon icon="cloud-download-fill" aria-hidden="true"></b-icon>
        and show/hide its features with
        <b-icon icon="arrow-down-up" aria-hidden="true"></b-icon>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Now you can choose how we should handle your query: Either show you a sortable table in the browser (standard,
        also by pressing Enter), send you an URL file containing download URLs for all instances which match your query
        or send you a CSV file representing the results
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You can use the query multiple times - just remember we always use the currently selected features and currently
        typed query for each request
    </li>
