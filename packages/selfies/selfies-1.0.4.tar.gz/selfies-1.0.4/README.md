A main objective is to use SELFIES as direct input into machine learning models,<br>
in particular in generative models, for the generation of molecular graphs<br>
which are syntactically and semantically valid.

Alternatively, it can be built from the ``docs/`` directory.

## Usage

### Standard Functions

The ``selfies`` library has eight standard functions:

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ``selfies.encoder`` | Translates a SMILES into an equivalent SELFIES. |
| ``selfies.decoder`` | Translates a SELFIES into an equivalent SMILES. |
| ``selfies.len_selfies`` | Returns the (symbol) length of a SELFIES.  |
| ``selfies.split_selfies`` | Splits a SELFIES into its symbols. |
| ``selfies.get_alphabet_from_selfies`` | Builds an alphabet of SELFIES symbols from an iterable of SELFIES. |
| ``selfies.get_semantic_robust_alphabet`` | Returns a subset of all SELFIES symbols that are semantically constrained. |
| ``selfies.selfies_to_encoding`` | Converts a SELFIES into a label and/or one-hot encoding. |
| ``selfies.encoding_to_selfies`` | Converts a label or one-hot encoding into a SELFIES. |

Please read the documentation for more detailed descriptions of these
functions, and to view the advanced functions, which allow users to
customize the SELFIES language.

### Examples

#### Translation between SELFIES and SMILES representations:

```python
import selfies as sf

benzene = "c1ccccc1"

# SMILES --> SELFIES translation
encoded_selfies = sf.encoder(benzene)  # '[C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][Branch1_2]'

# SELFIES --> SMILES translation
decoded_smiles = sf.decoder(encoded_selfies)  # 'C1=CC=CC=C1'

len_benzene = sf.len_selfies(encoded_selfies)  # 8

symbols_benzene = list(sf.split_selfies(encoded_selfies))
# ['[C]', '[=C]', '[C]', '[=C]', '[C]', '[=C]', '[Ring1]', '[Branch1_2]']
```

#### Integer and one-hot encoding SELFIES:
In this example we first build an alphabet
from a dataset of SELFIES, and then convert a SELFIES into a
padded, label-encoded representation. Note that we use the
``'[nop]'`` ([no operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code) ))
symbol to pad our SELFIES, which is a special SELFIES symbol that is always
ignored and skipped over by ``selfies.decoder``, making it a useful
padding character.

```python
import selfies as sf

dataset = ['[C][O][C]', '[F][C][F]', '[O][=O]', '[C][C][O][C][C]']
alphabet = sf.get_alphabet_from_selfies(dataset)
alphabet.add('[nop]')  # '[nop]' is a special padding symbol
alphabet = list(sorted(alphabet))
print(alphabet)  # ['[=O]', '[C]', '[F]', '[O]', '[nop]']

pad_to_len = max(sf.len_selfies(s) for s in dataset)  # 5
symbol_to_idx = {s: i for i, s in enumerate(alphabet)}

# SELFIES to label encode
dimethyl_ether = dataset[0]  # '[C][O][C]'

# [1, 3, 1, 4, 4]
print(sf.selfies_to_encoding(dimethyl_ether,
                             vocab_stoi=symbol_to_idx,
                             pad_to_len=pad_to_len,
                             enc_type='label'))
                             
# [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
print(sf.selfies_to_encoding(dimethyl_ether,
                             vocab_stoi=symbol_to_idx,
                             pad_to_len=pad_to_len,
                             enc_type='one_hot'))
```

### More Examples

* More examples can be found in the ``examples/`` directory, including a
[variational autoencoder that runs on the SELFIES](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies/tree/master/examples/vae_example) language.
* This [ICLR2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11655) used SELFIES in a
genetic algorithm to achieve state-of-the-art performance for inverse design,
with the [code here](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/GA).
* SELFIES allows for [highly efficient exploration and interpolation of the chemical space](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Beyond_Generative_Models_Superfast_Traversal_Optimization_Novelty_Exploration_and_Discovery_STONED_Algorithm_for_Molecules_using_SELFIES/13383266), with a [deterministic algorithms, see code](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/stoned-selfies).
* We use SELFIES for [Deep Molecular dreaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09712), a new generative model inspired by interpretable neural networks in computational vision. See the [code of PASITHEA here](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/Pasithea).
* Kohulan Rajan, Achim Zielesny, Christoph Steinbeck show in two papers that SELFIES outperforms other representations in [img2string](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-020-00469-w) and [string2string](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/STOUT_SMILES_to_IUPAC_Names_Using_Neural_Machine_Translation/13469202/1) translation tasks, see the codes of [DECIMER](https://github.com/Kohulan/DECIMER-Image-to-SMILES) and [STOUT](https://github.com/Kohulan/Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator). 


## Handling invalid inputs
If an invalid input is presented to the encoder or decoder, the return value is `None`.
The error can be analysed by using the `encoder(...,print_error=True)` option.
```python
import selfies as sf
invalid_smiles="C[C@H](O)[C@@(*)C1=CC=CC=C1"
selfies_string=sf.encoder(invalid_smiles) 

if selfies_string==None:
    selfies_string=sf.encoder(invalid_smiles,print_error=True) 
    # 'Encoding error 'C[C@H](O)[C@@(*)C1=CC=CC=C1': wildcard atom '*' not supported.'
```

## Tests
SELFIES uses `pytest` with `tox` as its testing framework.
All tests can be found in  the `tests/` directory. To run the test suite for
SELFIES, install ``tox`` and run:  

```bash
tox
```

By default, SELFIES is tested against a random subset
(of size ``dataset_samples=100000``) on various datasets:

 * 130K molecules from [QM9](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201422)
 * 250K molecules from [ZINC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZINC_database)
 * 50K molecules from [non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435117301307)
 * 8K molecules from [Tox21](http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1) in MoleculeNet
 * 93K molecules from PubChem [MUV](http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1) in MoleculeNet
 * 27M molecules from the [eMolecules Plus Database](https://www.emolecules.com/info/plus/download-database).
   Due to its large size, this dataset is not included on the repository. To run tests 
   on it, please download the dataset in the ``tests/test_sets`` directory 
   and enable its pytest at ``tests/test_on_emolecules.py``. 

Other tests are random and repeated ``trials`` number of times.
These can be specified as arguments

```bash
tox -- --trials 100 --dataset_samples 100
```

where ``--trials=100000`` and ``--dataset_samples=100000`` by default. Note that
if ``dataset_samples`` is negative or exceeds the length of the dataset,
the whole dataset is used.
