class ExposureMap:
    """ A class for calculating maps based on user specifications

    Each instance of this class contains information required to calculate and illustrate a map
    of exposure information, be that simple averages or more advanced mathematical representations
    of exposure risk. The class is designed to have three core functions run in sequence, with
    room for flexibility should more advanced users desire it. First, the data is read and a pixel
    histogram is calculated. This allows much more data to be stored in memory and is the basis
    for performing this kind of data analysis on personal computers.


    Parameters
    ----------
    
    units : str
        The units of the quantity to be mapped. Must be "SED", "J m-2" or "UVIh" for doses or "UVI",
        "W m-2" or "mW m-2" for irradiances. Defaults to "SED".

    exposure_schedule : array
        A vector of values describing the relative exposure of each hour of the day. 0 indicates no
        exposure, 1 indicates full exposure, and a fractional value such as 0.5 would indicate 
        exposure for a total of 30 minutes within the hour, or a 50% partial exposure for the full
        hour, or anything equivalent. Values greater than 1 are allowed. Must have a length of 24 (for 
        each hour of the day) although a length of 1 is also allowed, in which case that number will 
        be immediately replicated across a 24-length vector. When not calculating doses, hours with 
        any non-zero entry in this vector are included, with the irradiance values being 
        multiplied by the corresponding non-zero value in the exposure schedule.

    bin_width : float
        The width of each bin in the pixel histogram. Value assumed to be in the same units as 
        defined by the units parameter. *Making bin_width excessively small can lead to high
        memory usage,* consider the underlying accuracy of the source data and be sure not to
        substantially exceed its precision with this parameter.

    statistic : str
        The statistical descriptor to be calculated from the pixel histograms to be later 
        represented on the rendered map. Must contain at least one of these keywords:
        "mean", "median" or "med", "sd" or "std" or "stdev", "max" or "maximum", "min" or 
        "minimum". 

        *Planned:* the string can be a formula using any of the keywords above,
        as well at "prct" or "percentile" preceeded by a number between 0 and 100, and 
        basic mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, **) and numeric factors.

    date_selection : list of dates
        The dates for which the irradiances are retrieved or the daily doses are calculated. 
        Defaults to None whereby the program selects all data within the data_directory that
        matches the src_filename_format.

    src_filename_format : str
        Describes the filename of the netCDF files containing the data with 'yyyy' in place 
        of the year.
    
    data_directory : str
        The directory where the data is stored. Must end with a slash.


    Example
    -------

    The code below shows a typical use case for the ExposureMap class. The long-term average daily doses
    (i.e. the chronic doses) for typical school children are calculated across Switzerland asssuming certain
    hours of exposure for journeying to and from school and having breaks for morning tea and lunch time.

            Defaults to None whereby the program selects all data within the data_directory that
            matches the src_filename_format.

        units : str
            Name of units of desired output. This also indicates whether daily doses must be 
            calculated or not. Units of "SED", "J m-2", or "UVIh" will produce daily doses,
            units of "UVI", "W m-2" or "mW m-2" will not. 

        exposure_schedule : array
            A vector of values describing the relative exposure of each hour of the day. 0 indicates no
            exposure, 1 indicates full exposure, and a fractional value such as 0.5 would indicate

        Returns
        -------

        python_tamer.ExposureMap
            The input ExposureMap object is appended with new fields, `pix_hist` contains
            the counts for the histogram, and `bin_edges`, `bin_centers`, and `num_bins`
            all serve as metadata for the pixel histograms. `lat` and `lon` are also 
            added from the multi-file dataset to inform the pixel locations for map making
            further down the typical pipeline.
        
        
        Example
        -------

        The example code below shows how an ExposureMap class can be declared with the default parameters that
        can then be later redefined by collect_data() and the other class functions.

        applied to each pixel of the pix_hist object within the ExposureMap class, essentially
        removing the first dimension and resulting in straightforward map to be plotted.


        Parameters
        ----------

        pix_hist : array
            A 3D array with the first dimension containing vectors of counts for histograms
            and the next two dimensions serving as pixel coordinates. See 
            `ExposureMap.collect_data()` for more information.

        statistic : str
            The statistical descriptor to be calculated from the pixel histograms to be later 
            represented on the rendered map. Must contain at least one of these keywords:
            "mean", "median" or "med", "sd" or "std" or "stdev", "max" or "maximum", "min" or 
            "minimum". 

            *Planned:* the string can be a formula using any of the keywords above,
            as well at "prct" or "percentile" preceeded by a number between 0 and 100, and 
            basic mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, **) and numeric factors.
            
        bin_centers : array
            The central numeric values corresponding to the bins in pix_hist. The 
            `ExposureMap.collect_data` function typically calculates these values from the
            given `bin_width` input.


        Returns
        -------
        python_tamer.ExposureMap
            The ExposureMap class object is appended with a map field containing a 2D array


        Example
        -------

        In the example below, the user imports some pre-calculated pixel histograms, thereby
        completing the ExposureMap workflow without using the `ExposureMap.ExposureMap.collect_data()`
        function. This can be useful if the data collection is timely and the user wants to
        produce multiple different maps.

        """Renders and optionally saves a map of the ``map`` field in an ExposureMap object

        This function caps off the typical workflow for the ExposureMap class by rendering the contents
        of the map field. Many aesthetic factors are accounted for, contained within the
        `ExposureMap.map_options` dictionary.


        Parameters
        ----------

        map_options : dict, optional
            A collection of many typical options such as image and font sizes, colormaps, etc.
            The full range of options is listed below with their default values.

            "title" : "Test map", 
            The title to be rendered above the map. Can be left blank for no title. Can be 
            used to inform img_filename

            "save" : True, 
            Boolean to declare whether the map should be saved as an image file or not.
            
            "img_size" : [20,15], 
            The size [width,height] of the image in cm.

            "img_dpi" : 300, 
            The dots per inch of the saved image.

            "img_dir" : "", 
            The directory for the image to be saved in, leaving it blank should result
            in images being saved in the working directory.

            "img_filename" : "timestamp", 
            The image filename as a string. The default value of "timestamp" is a keyword
            indicating that the function should generate a filename based on the time at
            the moment of the calculation, specified with the format %Y%m%d_%H%M%S_%f 
            which includes millisecond precision.

            "img_filetype" : "png", 
            The image filetype, must be acceptable to `matplotlib.pyplot.savefig()`.

            "brdr_nation" : True, 
            Boolean for drawing national borders on the map.

            "brdr_nation_rgba" : [0,0,0,0], 
            The red, green, blue, and alpha values for the national borders.

            "brdr_state" : False, 
            Boolean for drawing state borders as defined by Natural Earth dataset.

            "brdr_state_rgba" : [0,0,0,0.67], 
            The red, green, blue, and alpha values for the national borders.

            "cmap" : "jet", 
            The name of the colourmap to be used when rendering the map.

            "cmap_limits" : None, 
            The numeric limits of the colourmap. Defaults to None, where the lower
            and upper limits of the plotted data are used as the colourmap limits.

            "cbar" : True, 
            Boolean for rendering a colourbar.

            "cbar_limits" : None, 
            The numeric limits of the colourbar. Defaults to None, where the lower
            and upper limits of the plotted data are used as the colourbar limits.
