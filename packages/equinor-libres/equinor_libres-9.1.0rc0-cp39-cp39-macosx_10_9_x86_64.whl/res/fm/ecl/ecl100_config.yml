# NB: There are inter related dependencies between this file, the EclConfig
#     class which essentially internalizes this file and the EclRun class
#     which uses the EclConfig class.
#
# The information about eclipse versions installed at a particular site is
# assembled in configuration files like this one, there are separate files for
# ecl100, ecl300 and opm/flow. The file has only one required top level element:
# 'versions' - which describe the versions which are installed. In
# additon you can optionally have a top level element 'env' which is a
# dictionary representing environment variables which should be set before the
# simulator starts.
#
# In the example below the ecl100 simulator is installed in versions '2015.2'
# and '2017.2'. Each version of the program can exist as a scalar single process
# application and a parallell MPI application. When we have drilled all the way
# down through versions['2105.2']['scalar'] the only required
# attribute is 'executable' which is the full path to the executable program. In
# addition you can add an env: setting which will be a dictionary of environment
# variables which will be set before the simulator is invoked. The 2015.2 mpi
# version has an example of such a settings.
#
# If it is an MPI simulation you must in addition to the executable attribute
# also set an 'mpirun' attribute.

# You can have a shared 'env' attribute which is an environment variable map
