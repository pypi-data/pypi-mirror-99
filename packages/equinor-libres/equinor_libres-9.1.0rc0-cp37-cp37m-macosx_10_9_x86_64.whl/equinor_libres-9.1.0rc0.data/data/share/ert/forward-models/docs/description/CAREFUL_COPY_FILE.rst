The :code:`CAREFUL_COPY_FILE` job will copy a file. If the :code:`<TO>`
argument has a directory component, that directory will be created.
This is an extension of the normal :code:`cp` command
which will *not* create directories in this way.
This job superseded an older version called :code:`CAREFULL_COPY`
and should be used instead.
