Description: # rfwtools
        
        This package provides commonly used functionality around CEBAF C100 RF Waveforms collected by the JLab harvestser.  This
        includes data management such as download capture files, reading data from disk, parsing label files, running feature
        extraction tasks, and generating data reports and visualizations.

        ## Installation
        
        This package has been posted to PyPI to ease installation.
        
        ```bash
        pip install rfwtools
        ```
        
        If you would rather edit the code while using it you should do a git clone to a local directory, then install that
        package in edit-able mode.
        
        ```bash
        cd /some/place
        git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/rfwtools .
        
        # Install the package (recommended that you use a virtual environment, etc.)
        pip install -e /some/place/rfwtools
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Internally the package leverages a Config class that contains directory locations, URLs for network services, etc..  On
        first reference, this class looks for and parses a config file, ./rfwtools.cfg.  Below is simplified example file.
        
        ```yaml
        data_dir: /some/path/rfw-research/data/waveforms/data/rf
        label_dir: /some/path/rfw-research/data/labels
        output_dir: /some/path/rfw-research/processed-output
        ```
        
        data_dir
        : Base directory containing RF waveform data directory structures (i.e., directory containing zone directories).  This path may include a symlink on Linux if you do not wish to duplicate data.  The path structure should mimic that found in opsdata.
        label_dir
        : Directory contain label files (typically provided by Tom Powers)
        output_dir
        : Default directory for writing/reading saved files and other processed output
        
        If no file is found, file system paths are relative the project base, which is assumed to be the current working
        directory.  You can adjust these parameters in code as in the example below.
        
        ```python
        from rfwtools.config import Config
        Config().data_dir = "/some/new/path"
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Previous usage of this was to download a template directory structure with source code.  This proved cumbersome, and 
        did not result in widespread usage.  Below is a simple example that assume the above locations were sensibly defined.
        It shows some of what you can accomplish with the package.
        
        ```python
        from rfwtools.data_set import DataSet
        from rfwtools.extractor.autoregressive import autoregressive_extractor
        
        # Create a DataSet.  For demo-purposes, I would make a small label file and run through.  This can take hours/days to
        # process all of our data
        ds = DataSet(label_files=['my-sample-labels.txt'])
        
        # This will process the label files you have and create an ExampleSet under ds.example_set
        ds.produce_example_set()
        
        # Save a CSV of the examples.
        ds.save_example_set_csv("my_example_set.csv")
        
        # Show data from label sources, color by fault_label
        ds.example_set.display_frequency_barplot(x='label_source', color_by="fault_label")
        
        # Show heatmaps for 1L22-1L26
        ds.example_set.display_zone_label_heatmap(zones=['1L22', '1L23', '1L24', '1L25', '1L26'])
        
        # Generate autoregressive features for this data set.  This can take a while - e.g. a few seconds per example.
        ds.produce_feature_set(autoregressive_extractor)
        
        # Save the feature_set to a CSV
        ds.save_feature_set_csv("my_feature_set.csv")
        
        # Do dimensionality reduction
        ds.feature_set.do_pca_reduction(n_components=10)
        
        # Plot out some different aspects
        # Color by fault, marker style by cavity
        ds.feature_set.display_2d_scatterplot(hue="fault_label", style="cavity_label")
        
        # Color by zone, marker style by cavity, only microphonics faults
        ds.feature_set.display_2d_scatterplot(hue="zone", style="cavity_label", query="fault_label == 'Microphonics'")
        ```
