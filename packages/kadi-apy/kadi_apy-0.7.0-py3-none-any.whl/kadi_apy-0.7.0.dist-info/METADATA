# Kadi-APY

**Kadi-APY** is a library for use in tandem with
[Kadi4Mat](https://gitlab.com/iam-cms/kadi "Kadi4Mat"). The REST-like API of
Kadi4Mat makes it possible to programmatically interact with most of the
resources that can be used through the web interface by sending suitable HTTP
requests to the different endpoints the API provides. Detailed information
about the API itself can be found in the developer documentation of Kadi4Mat.

The goal of this library is to make the use of this API as easy as possible. It
offers both an object oriented approach to work with the API in Python as well
as a command line interface (CLI). The library is written in Python 3 and works
under both Linux and Windows.

## Installation

The library can be installed using `pip3` (or `pip`, if there is no dedicated
version of `pip` for Python 3 installed), which generally comes bundled with
Python installations. Python version >= 3.6 is required.

`pip3 install kadi-apy`

When installing the library from source for development instead, it is
recommended to install the library in editable mode, which simply creates a
link to the sources so all changes are reflected in the installed package
immediately. The command will also install some additional development
dependencies as defined in  `setup.py`.

`pip3 install -e .[dev]`

Running the installations inside a virtual environment is recommended, see
[Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/ "Virtualenv") for more
information.

If you want to use the CLI, make sure the `kadi-apy` command is runnable from
anywhere. Depending on the type of installation and if a virtual environment is
used or not, the `PATH` system variable may need to be adapted accordingly to
include the path the executable resides in. For example, the following command
can be used on Linux, assuming the executable resides in `~/.local/bin`:

`export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}`

This line can also be added to `.bashrc` so it will be executed each time a new
terminal is opened:

`echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}' >> ${HOME}/.bashrc`

On Windows, the `PATH` can be modified permanently by editing the respective
environment variable in the advanced system settings of the control panel.

To upgrade, run

`pip3 install --upgrade kadi-apy`

if you installed the library directly without source code. Otherwise fetch the latest
code and install it again.

## Usage

The library can be used by either directly importing it into any Python code or
script or by using the CLI.

The latter can be used directly in the terminal, inside a shell script or by
running it as an external command inside most programming languages. The first
entry point to the CLI is given by running:

`kadi-apy`

All commands concerning different resources are available as various
subcommands. For example, all subcommands to work with records can be listed by
running:

`kadi-apy records`

The information on how to create a record can be accessed via:

`kadi-apy records create --help`

More examples of using the library can be found inside the `examples` directory
inside this project, including a Python, bash and PowerShell script.

Autocomplete can be activated via

`kadi-apy config activate-autocompletion`

for fish, Zsh, Bash and PowerShell.

## Connecting a Kadi4Mat instance

To connect an instance of Kadi4Mat to a local installation of this library, the
host of the Kadi4Mat instance as well as a personal access token (PAT) are
required.

The host is the fully qualified domain name of the Kadi4Mat instance, e.g.
`https://kadi4mat.iam-cms.kit.edu` or `http://localhost:5000` for a typical
local development installation.

A PAT can be created via the web interface of a Kadi4Mat instance in the menu
found in *Settings > Access tokens* and will operate with the same permissions
as the user that created the token. Besides specifying the name of the token,
which only becomes important when managing multiple tokens, an expiration date
can be set. This date can optionally be used to prohibit the usage of the token
beyond the specified date. If no date is given, the token will never expire. As
another security feature, a token can be limited to one or multiple *scopes*.
Scopes can restrict a token's access to specific resources or actions. If no
scopes are selected, the token will have full access by default.

You can run

`kadi-apy config create`

which creates the file `.kadiconfig` in you home directory. Open the file to fill in the
host and PAT information. E.g.:

```
[global]
timeout = 60
default = my_instance
verify = True                   # Whether to verify the SSL/TLS certificate of the host.
ca_bundle = /path/to/certfile   # Optional CA bundle for SSL/TLS verification.

[my_instance]
host = https://example.com/
pat = <your PAT>

[my_second_instance]
host = https://example2.com/
pat = <your second PAT>
```

When using the CLI, you can choose the instance to use. The default is defined by the
key `default` in the section `[global]`. Optionally, you can include a path to
certificates of trusted CAs in the config file via adding
`ca_bundle = /path/to/certfile` which is used in case of `verify = True`.
