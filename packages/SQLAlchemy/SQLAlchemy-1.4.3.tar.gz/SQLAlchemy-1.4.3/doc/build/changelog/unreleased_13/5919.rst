    Repaired / implemented support for primary key constraint naming
    conventions that use column names/keys/etc as part of the convention. In
    particular, this includes that the :class:`.PrimaryKeyConstraint` object
    that's automatically associated with a :class:`.schema.Table` will update
    its name as new primary key :class:`_schema.Column` objects are added to
    the table and then to the constraint. Internal failure modes related to
    this constraint construction process including no columns present, no name
    present or blank name present are now accommodated.
