    Fixed bug where the "schema_translate_map" feature failed to be taken into
    account for the use case of direct execution of
    :class:`_schema.DefaultGenerator` objects such as sequences, which included
    the case where they were "pre-executed" in order to generate primary key
    values when implicit_returning was disabled.
