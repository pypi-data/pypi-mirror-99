Heading level 1
===============

ReStructured Text doesn't care what markers you use for headings,
but it does require you to be consistent.  Here's what we are using
in the Image API reference documents.

Level 1 is mostly used in the .rst files.  For the .inc files,
the top-level heading will most likely be a Level 2.
