    The deprecation path for the configuration option
    ``show_multiple_locations`` has been changed because
    the mitigation instructions for `OSSN-0065`_ refer to
    this option. It is now subject to removal on or after
    the **Pike**  release. The help text for this option
    has been updated accordingly.
