    The policy check that we ran when an image is not found is
    removed. This previously allowed an operator to override the
    behavior of a 404 to be a 403, in contrast to the API
    documentation and design goals of defaulting to 404 for
    information-hiding reasons. This check is no longer run in the
    case of a NotFound result from the database, so any policy
    attempting to control that behavior will be ignored from now on.
