    This release implements the Glance spec `Secure Hash Algorithm Support
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/approved/glance/multihash.html>`_
    (also known as "multihash").  This feature supplements the current
    'checksum' image property with a self-describing secure hash.  The
    self-description consists of two new image properties:

    * ``os_hash_algo`` - this contains the name of the secure hash algorithm
      used to generate the value on this image
    * ``os_hash_value`` - this is the hexdigest computed by applying the
      secure hash algorithm named in the ``os_hash_algo`` property to the
      image data

    These are read-only image properties and are not user-modifiable.

    The secure hash algorithm used is an operator-configurable setting.  See
    the help text for 'hashing_algorithm' in the sample Glance configuration
    file for more information.

    The default secure hash algorithm is SHA-512.  It should be suitable for
    most applications.

    The legacy 'checksum' image property, which provides an MD5 message
    digest of the image data, is preserved for backward compatibility.
issues:
  - |
    The ``os_hash_value`` image property, introduced as part of the
    `Secure Hash Algorithm Support
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/approved/glance/multihash.html>`_
    ("multihash") feature, is limited to 128 characters.  This is sufficient
    to store 512 bits as a hexadecimal numeral.

    The "multihash" implemented in this release (`Secure Hash Algorithm Support
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/approved/glance/multihash.html>`_)
    is computed only for new images.  There is no provision for computing
    the multihash for existing images.  Thus, users should expect to see
    JSON 'null' values for the ``os_hash_algo`` and ``os_hash_value`` image
    properties on images created prior to the installation of the Rocky
    release at your site.

    This release implements the Glance spec `Secure Hash Algorithm Support
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/approved/glance/multihash.html>`_,
    which introduces a self-describing "multihash" to the image-show response.
    This feature supplements the current 'checksum' image property with a
    self-describing secure hash.  The default hashing algorithm is SHA-512,
    which is currently considered secure.  In the event that algorithm is
    compromised, you will immediately be able to begin using a different
    algorithm (as long as it's supported by the Python 'hashlib' library and
    has output that fits in 128 characters) by modifying the value of the
    'hashing_algorithm' configuration option and either restarting or issuing
    a SIGHUP to Glance.
