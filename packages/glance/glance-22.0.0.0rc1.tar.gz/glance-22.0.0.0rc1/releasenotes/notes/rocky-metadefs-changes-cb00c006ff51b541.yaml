    The following metadata definitions have been modified in the Rocky
    release:

    * There was a typographical error in the properties target for the
      ``OS:::Nova::Server`` resource type association in the
      ``CIM::ProcessorAllocationSettingData`` namespace.  It has been
      been corrected to ``scheduler_hints``.

    You may upgrade these definitions using:

    ``glance-manage db load_metadefs [--path <path>] [--merge] [--prefer_new]``
