  - All ``qemu-img info`` calls are now run under resource
    limitations that limit the CPU time and address space
    usage of the process running the command to 2 seconds
    and 1 GB respectively. This addresses the bug
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1449062

    Current usage of "qemu-img" is limited to Glance tasks,
    which by default (since the Mitaka release) are only
    available to admin users. We continue to recommend that
    tasks only be exposed to trusted users
