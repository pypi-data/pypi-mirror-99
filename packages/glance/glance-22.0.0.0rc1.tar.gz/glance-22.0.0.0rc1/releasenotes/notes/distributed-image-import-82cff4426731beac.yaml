    Glance now supports the ``glance-direct`` import method without
    needing shared storage common to all API workers. By telling each
    API worker the URL by which it can be reached directly (from the
    other workers), a shared staging directory can be avoided while
    still allowing users to upload their data for import. See the
    ``worker_self_reference_url`` config option for more details, as
    well as the `Interoperable Image Import
    <https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/interoperable-image-import.html>`_
    docs.
