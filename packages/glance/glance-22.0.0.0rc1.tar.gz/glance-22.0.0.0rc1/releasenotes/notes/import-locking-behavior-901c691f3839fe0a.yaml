    Bug 1884596_: A change was added to the import API which provides
    time-based locking of an image to exclude other import operations
    from starting until the lock-holding task completes. The lock is
    based on the task that we start to do the work, and the UUID of
    that task is stored in the ``os_glance_import_task`` image property,
    which indicates who owns the lock. If the task holding the lock fails
    to make progress for 60 minutes, another import operation will be
    allowed to steal the lock and start another import operation.
