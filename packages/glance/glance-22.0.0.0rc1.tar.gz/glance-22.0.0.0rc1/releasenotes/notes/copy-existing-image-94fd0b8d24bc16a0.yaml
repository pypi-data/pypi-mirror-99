upgrade:
  - |
    Added new import method ``copy-image`` which will copy existing image
    into multiple stores. The new import method will work only if multiple
    stores are enabled in the deployment. To use this feature operator
    needs to mention ``copy-image`` import method in ``enabled_import_methods``
    configuration option. Note that this new internal plugin applies *only* to
    images imported via the `interoperable image import process`_.
