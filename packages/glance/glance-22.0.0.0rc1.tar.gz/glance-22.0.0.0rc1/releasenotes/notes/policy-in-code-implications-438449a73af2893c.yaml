    Operators who use property protections with the
    ``property_protection_rule_format`` set to  ``policies`` must still
    define the policy rules used for property protections in a policy
    file.  The content of the file may be JSON or YAML.  Additionally,
    we suggest that the absolute pathname of this file be set as the
    value of ``policy_file`` in the ``[oslo_policy]`` section of the
    ``glance-api.conf`` file.

    Be aware that if you define a policy rule for ``default`` or
    ``context_is_admin``, that policy rule will also be used by the
    policies that govern permissions to perform actions using the
    Images API, even if these actions are not specified in the policy
    file.
