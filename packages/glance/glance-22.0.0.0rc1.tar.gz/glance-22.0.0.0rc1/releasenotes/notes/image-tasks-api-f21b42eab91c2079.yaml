    While fixing race condition issue during victoria we started
    updating 'message' property of the task which helps calculate
    time based on last updated time of task to burst the lock as well
    as show how much data has been copied of that image. As glance
    task API's are restricted from use by normal users we are adding
    new API /v2/images/{image_id}/tasks which will return all tasks
    associated with that image. In addition to task information
    this API will also return `request-id` and `user-id` to help
    users in debugging.
