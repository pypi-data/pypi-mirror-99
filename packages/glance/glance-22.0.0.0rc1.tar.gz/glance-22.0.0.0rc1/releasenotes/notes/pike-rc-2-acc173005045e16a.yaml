    A new policy, ``tasks_api_access`` has been introduced so that ordinary
    user credentials may be used by Glance to manage the tasks that accomplish
    the interoperable image import process without requiring that operators
    expose the Tasks API to end users.

    If you wish to enable the EXPERIMENTAL version 2.6 API that contains the
    new interoperable image import functionality, set the configuration option
    ``enable_image_import`` to True in the glance-api.conf file.  The default
    value for this option is False.

    The interoperable image import functionality uses the Glance tasks
    engine.  This is transparent to end users, as they do *not* use the
    Tasks API for the interoperable image import workflow.  The operator,
    however, must make sure that the following configuration options
    are set correctly.

    - ``enable_image_import``
    - ``node_staging_uri``
    - the options in the ``[task]`` group
    - the options in the ``[taskflow_executor]`` group

    See the documentation in the sample glance-api.conf file for more
    information.

    Additionally, you will need to verify that the task-related policies
    in the Glance policy.json file are set correctly.  These settings are
    described below.

    A new policy, ``tasks_api_access`` has been introduced so that ordinary
    user credentials may be used by Glance to manage the tasks that accomplish
    the interoperable image import process without requiring that operators
    expose the Tasks API to end users.

    The `Tasks API`_ was made admin-only by default in Mitaka by restricting
    the following policy targets to **role:admin**: **get_task**,
    **get_tasks**, **add_task**, and **modify_task**.

    The new ``tasks_api_access`` policy target directly controls access to the
    Tasks API, whereas targets just mentioned indirectly affect what can be
    manipulated via the API by controlling what operations can be performed
    on Glance's internal task objects.  The key point is that if you want to
    expose the new interoperable image import process to end users while
    keeping the Tasks API admin-only, you can accomplish this by using the
    following settings:

    .. code-block:: none

       "get_task": "",
       "get_tasks": "",
       "add_task": "",
       "modify_task": "",
       "tasks_api_access": "role:admin",

    To summarize: end users do **not** need access to the Tasks API in
    order to use the new interoperable image import process.  They do,
    however, need permission to access internal Glance task objects.

    We recommend that all operators adopt the policy settings just
    described independently of the decision whether to expose the
    EXPERIMENTAL version 2.6 API.

    This is a good time to review your Glance ``policy.json`` file to make
    sure that if it contains a ``default`` target, the rule is fairly
    restrictive ("role:admin" or "!" are good choices).  The ``default``
    target is used when the policy engine cannot find the target it's
    looking for.  This can happen when a new policy is introduced but the
    policy file in use is from a prior release.

    The Image Service API Reference has been updated with a section on the
    `Interoperable image import`_ process (also known as "image import
    refactored") and the API calls that are exposed to implement it in
    the EXPERIMENTAL v2.6 of the API.
