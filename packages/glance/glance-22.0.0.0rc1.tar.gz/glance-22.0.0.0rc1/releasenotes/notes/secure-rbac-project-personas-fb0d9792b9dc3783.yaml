features:
  - |
    Glance's default policies now use the `member` role on projects to protect
    writeable and readable image actions. Support was also added for read-only
    access to image resources when the `reader` role is granted to users on a
    project. Administrative operations, like creating public images, is still
    protected using the `admin` role on a project. Administrative actions will
    be updated in the future to consume system-scope.

    We encourage you to compare any existing overrides in your deployment with
    the new defaults. You can use `oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace
    glance` to generate the default policies and use them for comparison.

    The secure RBAC personas implemented in Wallaby are marked as experimental.
    They will become stable in a future release. You can read more about the
    various personas in keystone's `Administrator Guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/service-api-protection.html>`_.

    To enable this functionality, you must specify `glance-api.conf
    [DEFAULT] enable_secure_rbac=True` and `glance-api.conf [oslo_policy]
    enforce_new_defaults=True`. Glance will refuse to start if misconfigured.
upgrade:
  - |
    Glance now provides more granular RBAC access to the images API via default
    personas. This work is marked as experimental in Wallaby, and will be
    supported in a future release.

    Existing authorization and policies will continue to work, but we encourage
    operators to review the new policies and consolidate any redundant
    overrides with the new defaults if possible. Please review the feature
    section above for more details.
deprecations:
  - |
    The policies protecting the image API have been deprecated in favor of more
    consistent defaults that use the `member` and `reader` default roles from
    keystone. If your deployment relies on overriding the default policies,
    please review the new defaults and how they may impact your deployment.

    The unused `modify_task` policy has been deprecated for
    removal. It was never honored or checked as part of an API
    operation. As a result, it has been deprecated for removal since
    overriding it has no direct impact on the tasks API, which remains
    a deprecated, admin-only API.
security:
  - |
    Glance now ships experimental policies that support read-only image
    permissions. Users with the `reader` role on a project will be able to view
    generic image data, without the ability to make writeable changes using the
    images API. Please review the features section above for more information
    on enabling this functionality.
