  - Fixing bug 1525915; image might be transitioning
    from active to queued by regular user by removing
    last location of image (or replacing locations
    with empty list). This allows user to re-upload
    data to the image breaking Glance's promise of
    image data immutability. From now on, last
    location cannot be removed and locations cannot
    be replaced with empty list.
