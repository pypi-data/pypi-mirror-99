    Glance and Nova contain nearly identical digital
    signature modules. In order to better maintain and
    evolve this code and to eliminate the possibility that
    the modules diverge, we have replaced the digital
    signature module in Glance with the new ``cursive``
    library.

    * The ``cursive`` library is an OpenStack project which
      implements OpenStack-specific verification of digital
      signatures.
    * In Newton, the majority of the signature verification
      code was removed from Glance. ``cursive`` has been
      added to Glance as a dependency and will be installed
      by default.
    * Glance uses the ``cursive`` library's functionality to
      verify digital signatures. To familiarize yourself
      with this new dependency and see the list of
      transitive dependencies visit
