  - Sample configuration file shipped with Glance source now
    has reordered store drivers configuration options for
    future consistent ordering.

  - |
    The sample configuration files autogenerated using the
    oslo-config-generator tool now give consistent ordering
    of the store drivers configurations.

    * Some operators have reported issues with reordering
      observed in the sample configurations shipped with
      Glance release tarballs. This reordering may result
      into a incorrect "diff" of the configurations used
      downstream vs. newly introduced upstream.
    * Latest release of ``glance_store`` library (used
      in the **Newton** release of Glance) will include fix
      for the ``glance_store`` bug 1619487.
    * Until now every run of the oslo-config-generator
      resulted in random ordering of the store drivers
      configuration. After **Newton** release this order
      will remain consistent.
    * The store drivers configuration order in the sample or
      autogenerated files should be expected to be
      alphabetical as - ``cinder``, ``filesystem``,
      ``http``, ``rbd``, ``sheepdog``, ``swift``,
      ``vmware``.
    * Note the code name for the "ceph" driver is ``rbd``.
    * Note the ordering of the options within a store is not
      alphabetical.
