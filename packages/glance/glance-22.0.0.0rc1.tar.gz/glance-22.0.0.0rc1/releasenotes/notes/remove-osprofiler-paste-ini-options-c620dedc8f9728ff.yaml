deprecations:
  - OSprofiler support requires passing of trace information
    between various OpenStack services. This information is
    signed by one of HMAC keys, which we historically defined
    in glance-api-paste.ini and glance-registry-paste.ini files
    (together with enabled option, that in fact was duplicated in
    the corresponding configuration files).
    OSprofiler 0.3.1 and higher supports passing this information
    via configuration files, therefore it's recommended to
    modify the ``[filter:osprofiler]`` section in  \*-paste.ini to look like
    ``paste.filter_factor = osprofiler.web:WsgiMiddleware.factory``
    and set the ``hmac_keys`` option in the glance-\*.conf files.
