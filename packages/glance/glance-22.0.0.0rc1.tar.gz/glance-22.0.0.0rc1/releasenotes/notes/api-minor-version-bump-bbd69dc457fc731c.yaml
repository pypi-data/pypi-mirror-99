    The **CURRENT** version of the version 2 Images API supplied
    by Glance is now **2.5**.  Changes include:

    * The 'visibility' enumeration has been increased from two values
      (``public``, ``private``) to four values (``public``, ``private``,
      ``shared``, and ``community``).

    * Formerly, it was possible to add members to an image whose
      visibility was ``private``, thereby creating a "shared" image.
      In this release, an image must have a visibility of ``shared``
      in order to accept member operations.  Attempting to add a
      member to an image with a visibility of ``private`` will result
      in a `4xx response`_ containing an informative message.

      .. _`4xx response`: https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/?expanded=create-image-member-detail#create-image-member
