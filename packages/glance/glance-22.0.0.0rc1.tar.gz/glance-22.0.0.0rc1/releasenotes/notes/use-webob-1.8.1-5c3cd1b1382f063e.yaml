    Negotiation of the 'Accept-Language' header now follows the "Lookup"
    matching scheme described in `RFC 4647, section 3.4
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647.html#section-3.4>`_. The
    "Lookup" scheme is one of the algorithms suggested in `RFC 7231,
    section 5.3.5
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html#section-5.3.5>`_. (This is
    due to a change in an underlying library, which previously used a
    matching scheme that did not conform to `RFC 7231
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231.html>`_.)
