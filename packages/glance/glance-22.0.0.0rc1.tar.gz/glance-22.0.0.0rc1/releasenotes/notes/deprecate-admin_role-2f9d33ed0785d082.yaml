deprecations:
  - |
    The Glance API configuration option ``admin_role`` is deprecated in this
    release and is subject to removal at the beginning of the Victoria
    development cycle, following the `OpenStack standard deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    What this option does is to grant complete admin access to any
    authenticated user with a particular role.  *This overrides any policy
    rules configured in the policy configuration file.*  While everything
    will behave as expected if you are also using the default policy settings,
    this setting may cause anomalous behavior when you are configuring custom
    policies.

    Additionally, the default value of this option has been changed in
    this release.  See the "Upgrade Notes" section of this document for
    more information.

    If you were previously aware of this option and were actually using it,
    we apologize for the inconvenience its removal will cause, but overall
    it will be better for everyone if policy configuration is confined to
    the policy configuration file and this backdoor is eliminated.  The
    migration path is to explictly mention the role you configured for this
    option in appropriate places in your policy configuration file.

    The default value of the Glance API configuration option ``admin_role``
    has been changed in this release.  If you were also using the default
    policy configuration, this change will not affect you.  If you were
    *not* using the default policy configuration, please read on.

    With the previous default value, any user with the ``admin`` role
    could act in an administrative context *regardless of what your
    policy file defined as the administrative context*.  And this might
    not be a problem because usually the ``admin`` role is not assigned
    to "regular" end users.  It does become a problem, however, when
    operators attempt to configure different gradations of administrator.

    In this release, the default value of ``admin_role`` has been defined
    as ``__NOT_A_ROLE_07697c71e6174332989d3d5f2a7d2e7c_NOT_A_ROLE__``.
    This effectively makes it inoperable (unless your Keystone administrator
    has actually created such a role and assigned it to someone, which is
    unlikely but possible, so you should check).  If your local policy tests
    (you have some, right?) indicate that your Glance policies no longer
    function as expected, then you have been relying on the ``admin_role``
    configuration option and need to revise your policy file.  (A short
    term fix would be to set the ``admin_role`` option back to ``admin``,
    but keep in mind that it *is* a short-term fix, because this
    configuration option is deprecated and subject to removal.)

    See the "Deprecation Notes" section of this document for more
    information.
