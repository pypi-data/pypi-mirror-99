features:
  - Implemented re-authentication with trusts when updating image status in
    registry after image upload. When long-running image upload takes some a lot
    of time (more than token expiration time) glance uses trusts to receive new
    token and update image status in registry. It allows users to upload big
    size images without increasing token expiration time.
