    Please note a change in the Scrubber's behavior in case
    of job fetching errors:

    * If configured to work in daemon mode, the Scrubber
      will log an error message at level critical, but
      will not exit the process.
    * If configured to work in non-daemon mode, the Scrubber
      will log an error message at level critical and exit
      with status one.
