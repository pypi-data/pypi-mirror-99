    The ``show_multiple_locations`` configuration option remains deprecated in
    this release, but it has not been removed.  (It had been scheduled for
    removal in the Pike release.)  Please keep a watch on the Glance release
    notes and the glance-specs repository to stay informed about developments
    on this issue.

    The plan is to eliminate the option and use only policies to control image
    locations access.  This, however, requires some major refactoring.  See the
    `draft Policy Refactor spec <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/528021/>`_
    for more information.

    There is no projected timeline for this change, as no one has been able to
    commit time to it.  The Glance team would be happy to discuss this more
    with anyone interested in working on it.

    The workaround is to continue to use the ``show_multiple_locations`` option
    in a dedicated "internal" Glance node that is not accessible to end users.
    We continue to recommend that image locations not be exposed to end users.
    See `OSSN-0065 <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0065>`_ for more
    information.
