    The Pike release notes pointed out that although support had been added to
    run Glance as a WSGI application hosted by a web server, the Glance team
    recommended that Glance be run in its normal standalone configuration,
    particularly in production environments.

    We renew that recommendation for the Queens release.  In particular, Glance
    tasks (which are required for the interoperable image import functionality)
    do not execute when Glance is run under uWSGI (which is the OpenStack
    recommended way to run WSGI applications hosted by a web server).

    This is in addition to the chunked transfer encoding problems addressed by
    `Bug 1703856`_ and will be more difficult to fix.  (Additionally, as far as
    we are aware, the fix for `Bug 1703856`_ has never been tested at scale.)
    Briefly, Glance tasks are run by the API service and would have to be split
    out into a different service so that API alone would run under uWSGI.  The
    Glance project team did not have sufficient testing and development
    resources during the Queens cycle to attempt this (or even to discuss
    whether this is in fact a good idea).

    The Glance project team is committed to the stability of Glance.  As part
    of OpenStack, we are committed to `The Four Opens`_.  If the ability to run
    Glance under uWSGI is important to you, feel free to participate in the
    Glance community to help coordinate and drive such an effort.  (We gently
    remind you that "participation" includes providing testing and development
    resources.)
