    Some backend store names were inconsistent between glance
    and glance_store.  This meant that operators of the
    VMware datastore or file system store were required to use
    store names in ``glance-api.conf`` that did not correspond
    to any valid identifier in glance_store.  As this situation
    encouraged misconfiguration and operator unhappiness, we
    have made the store names consistent in the Newton
    release. What this means for you:

    * This change applies only to operators who are using
      multiple image locations
    * This change applies only to operators using the VMware
      datastore or filesystem stores
    * This change applies only to the ``store_type_preference``
      option
    * *VMware datastore operators*: The old name, now
      **DEPRECATED**, was ``vmware_datastore``.  The **new**
      name, used in both glance and glance_store, is
      ``vmware``
    * *File system store operators*: the old name, now
      **DEPRECATED**, was ``filesystem``.  The **new** name,
      used in both glance and glance_store, is ``file``
    * This change is backward compatible, that is, the old
      names will be recognized by the code during the deprecation
      period. Support for the deprecated names will be removed in
      the **Pike** release
    * We strongly encourage operators to modify their
      ``glance-api.conf`` files immediately to use the **new**
      names
