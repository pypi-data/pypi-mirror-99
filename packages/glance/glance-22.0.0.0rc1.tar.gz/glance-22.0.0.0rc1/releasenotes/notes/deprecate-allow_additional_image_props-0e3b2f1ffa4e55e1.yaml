deprecations:
  - |
    The Glance API configuration option ``allow_additional_image_properties``
    is deprecated in this release and is subject to removal at the beginning
    of the Victoria development cycle, following the `OpenStack standard
    deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    The migration path for operators who were using this option in its
    nondefault ``False`` setting is to set the ``image_property_quota``
    option to ``0``.  Since many other OpenStack services depend upon the
    ability to read/write custom image properties, however, we suspect that
    no one has been using the option with a nondefault value.
