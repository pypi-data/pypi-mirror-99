  - |
    Added a plugin to inject image metadata properties to non-admin
    images created via the interoperable image import process.  This
    plugin implements the spec `Inject metadata properties automatically
    to non-admin images`_.  See the spec for a discussion of the use case
    addressed by this plugin.

    Use of the plugin requires configuration as described in the
    `The Image Property Injection Plugin`_ section of the Glance Admin Guide.

    Note that the plugin applies *only* to images imported via the
    `interoperable image import process`_.  Thus images whose data is
    set using the `image data upload`_ call will *not* be processed by
    the plugin and hence will not have properties injected.  You can
    force end users to use the interoperable image import process by
    restricting the data upload call, which is governed by the
    ``upload_image`` policy in the Glance ``policy.json`` file.  See
    the documentation for more information.
