    Using db check

    In order to check the current state of your database upgrades, you may run the
    command ``glance-manage db check``. This will inform you of any
    outstanding actions you have left to take.

    Here is a list of possible return codes:

    - A return code of ``0`` means you are currently up to date with the latest
      migration script version and all ``db`` upgrades are complete.

    - A return code of ``3`` means that an upgrade from your current database
      version is available and your first step is to run ``glance-manage db expand``.

    - A return code of ``4`` means that the expansion stage is complete, and the
      next step is to run ``glance-manage db migrate``.

    - A return code of ``5`` means that the expansion and data migration stages are
      complete, and the next step is to run ``glance-manage db contract``.
