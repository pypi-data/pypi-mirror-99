deprecations:
  - The task API was added to allow users for uploading images asynchronously
    and for deployers to have more control in the upload process. Unfortunately,
    this API has not worked the way it was expected to. Therefore, the task API
    has entered a deprecation period and it is meant to be replaced by the new
    import API. This change makes the task API admin only by default so that it
    is not accidentally deployed as a public API.
upgrade:
  - The task API is being deprecated and it has been made admin only. If deployers
    of Glance would like to have this API as a public one, it is necessary to
    change the `policy.json` file and remove `role:admin` from every `task`
    related field.
