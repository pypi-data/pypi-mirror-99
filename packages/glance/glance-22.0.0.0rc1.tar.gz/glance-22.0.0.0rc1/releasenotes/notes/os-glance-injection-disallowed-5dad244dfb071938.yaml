    The ``inject_image_metadata`` task will no longer allow setting
    properties in the reserved ``os_glance_*`` namespace, in line with
    the blanket prohibition on such via the API. It has always been
    dangerous to do this, so no operator should have any such
    configuration in production. If any keys in this namespace are
    set, they will be dropped (and logged) during the injection
    process.
