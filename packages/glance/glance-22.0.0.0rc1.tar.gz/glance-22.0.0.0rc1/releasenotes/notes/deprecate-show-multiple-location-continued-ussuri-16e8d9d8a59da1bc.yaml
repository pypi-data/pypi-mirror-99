    The ``show_multiple_locations`` configuration option remains DEPRECATED but
    not removed in the Ussuri release.  We continue to recommend that image
    locations not be exposed to end users.  See `OSSN-0065
    <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0065>`_ for more information.

    The plan continues to be to eliminate the option and use only policies to
    control image locations access.  This, however, requires some major
    refactoring, as discussed in the `draft Policy Refactor spec
    <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/528021/>`_.  Further, there is no
    projected timeline for this change, as no one has been able to commit time
    to it.  (The Glance team would be happy to discuss this more with anyone
    interested in working on it.)

    Please keep a watch on the Glance release notes and the glance-specs
    repository to stay informed about developments on this issue.
