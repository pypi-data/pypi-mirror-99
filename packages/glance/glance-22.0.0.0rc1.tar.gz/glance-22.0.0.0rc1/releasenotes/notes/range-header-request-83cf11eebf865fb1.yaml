    Glance had been accepting the Content-Range header for GET v2/images/{image_id}/file requests,
    contrary to RFC 7233.
    Following RFC 7233, Glance will now:

    * Accept the Range header in requests to serve partial images.
    * Include a ``Content-Range`` header upon successful delivery of the requested partial content.

    Please note that not all Glance storage backends support partial downloads. A Range request to a
    Glance server with such a backend will result in the entire image content being delivered
    despite the 206 response code.
