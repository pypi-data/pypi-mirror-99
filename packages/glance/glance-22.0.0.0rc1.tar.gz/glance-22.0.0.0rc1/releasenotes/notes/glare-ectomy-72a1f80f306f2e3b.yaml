    Code for the OpenStack Artifacts Service (`Glare`_) and its EXPERIMENTAL
    API has been removed from the Glance codebase, as it was relocated into an
    independent `Glare`_ project repository during a previous release cycle.
    The database upgrade for the Glance Pike release drops the Glare tables
    (named 'artifacts' and 'artifact_*') from the Glance database.

    OpenStack deployments, packagers, and deployment projects which provided
    Glare should have begun to consume Glare from its own `Glare`_ respository
    during the Newton and Ocata releases.  With the Pike release, it is no
    longer possible to consume Glare code from the Glance repository.

    Code for the OpenStack Artifacts Service (Glare) and its EXPERIMENTAL API
    has been `removed`_ from the Glance codebase.

    The Artifacts API was an EXPERIMENTAL API that ran on the Glance service
    endpoint as ``/v3`` in the Liberty release.  In the Mitaka release, the
    Glance ``/v3`` EXPERIMENTAL API was deprecated and the Artifacts Service
    ran on its own endpoint (completely independent from the Glance service
    endpoint) as an EXPERIMENTAL API, versioned as ``v0.1``.  In both the
    Liberty and Mitaka releases, Glare ran on code stored in the Glance code
    repository and used its own tables in the Glance database.

    In the Newton release, the Glare code was relocated into its own `Glare`_
    project repository.  Also in the Newton release, Glare ran an EXPERIMENTAL
    Artifacts API versioned as ``v1.0`` on its own endpoint and used its own
    database.

    For the Pike release, the legacy Glare code has been removed from the
    Glance code repository and the legacy 'artifacts' and 'artifact_*' database
    tables are dropped from the Glance database.  As the Artifacts service API
    was an EXPERIMENTAL API in Glance and has not used the Glance database
    since Mitaka, no provision is made for migrating data from the Glance
    database to the Glare database.
