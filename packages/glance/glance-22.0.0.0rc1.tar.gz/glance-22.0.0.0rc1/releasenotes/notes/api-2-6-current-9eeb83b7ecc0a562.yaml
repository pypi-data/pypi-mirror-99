  - The CURRENT version of the Images API v2 is bumped to **2.6**.
    The 2.6 API was available in the previous (Pike) release as an
    experimental API to introduce the calls necessary for the `interoperable
    image import functionality`_.
  - A new interoperable image import method, ``web-download`` is
    introduced.
features:
  - |
    A new interoperable image import method, ``web-download`` is
    introduced.  This method allows an end user to import an image from
    a remote URL.  The image data is retrieved from the URL and stored
    in the Glance backend.  (In other words, this is a **copy-from**
    operation.)

    This feature is enabled by default, but it is optional.  Whether
    it is offered at your installation depends on the value of the
    ``enabled_import_methods`` configuration option in the ``glance-api.conf``
    file (assuming, of course, that you have not disabled image import at
    your site).
upgrade:
  - |
    The **CURRENT** version of the Images API supplied by Glance
    is introduced as **2.6**.  It includes the new API calls introduced
    on an experimental basis in the Pike release.

    While the 2.6 API is CURRENT, whether the interoperable image import
    functionality it makes available is exposed to end users is controlled by a
    configuration option, ``enable_image_import``.  Although this option
    existed in the previous release, its effect is slightly different in
    Queens.

    * ``enable_image_import`` is **True** by default (in Pike it was False)

    * When ``enable_image_import`` is **True**, a new import-method,
      ``web-download`` is available.  (In Pike, only ``glance-direct`` was
      offered.)  Which import-methods you offer can be configured using
      the ``enabled_import_methods`` option in the ``glance-api.conf``
      file.

    * If ``enable_image_import`` is set **False**, requests to the v2 endpoint
      for URIs defined only in v2.6 will return 404 (Not Found) with a message
      in the response body stating "Image import is not supported at this
      site."  Additionally, the image-create response will not contain the
      "OpenStack-image-import-methods" header.

    The ``enable_image_import`` configuration option was introduced as
    DEPRECATED in Pike and will be removed in Rocky.

    The discovery calls defined in the `refactored image import spec`_
    remain in an abbreviated form in this release.

    Finally, there are no changes to the version 2.5 API in this release.  All
    version 2.5 calls will work whether the new import functionality is enabled
    or not.
