    As part of the multi-store efforts this release introduces deletion from
    single store. Through new '/v2/stores' endpoint the API user can request
    image to be deleted from single store instead of deleting the whole image.
    This feature can be used to clean up store metadata in cases where the
    image data has for some reason disappeared from the store already, except
    410 Gone HTTP response.
