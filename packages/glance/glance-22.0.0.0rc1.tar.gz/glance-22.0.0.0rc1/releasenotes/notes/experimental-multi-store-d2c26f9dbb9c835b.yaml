    This release provides an EXPERIMENTAL implementation of the Glance spec
    `Multi-Store Backend Support
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/implemented/glance/multi-store.html>`_,
    which allows an operator to configure multiple backing stores so that
    end users may direct image data to be stored in a specific backend.
    See `Multi Store Support
    <https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/multistores.html>`_
    in the Glance Administration Guide for more information.

    This experimental feature is optionally exposed as the EXPERIMENTAL
    Image Service API version 2.8.  Its use in production systems is currently
    **not supported**.  We encourage people to use this feature for testing
    purposes and report any issues so that it can be made stable and fully
    supported in the Stein release.

    The `Multi-Store Backend Support
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/implemented/glance/multi-store.html>`_
    feature is introduced on an experimental basis in the EXPERIMENTAL
    Image Service API version 2.8:

    * a new *list stores* call, `GET /v2/info/stores
      <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#list-stores>`_
    * a new ``OpenStack-image-store-ids`` header in the `create image
      <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#create-image>`_
      response
    * an ``X-Image-Meta-Store`` header may be included with the `image data
      upload
      <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#upload-binary-image-data>`_
      request
    * an ``X-Image-Meta-Store`` header may be included with the `image import
      <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#import-an-image>`_
      request

    Please keep in mind that as version 2.8 of the Image Service API is
    EXPERIMENTAL, we reserve the right to make modifications to these aspects
    of the API should user feedback indicate that a change is required.
