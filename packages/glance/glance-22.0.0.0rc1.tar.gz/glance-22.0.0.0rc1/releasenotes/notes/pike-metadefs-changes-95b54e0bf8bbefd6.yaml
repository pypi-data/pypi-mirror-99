    The following metadata definitions have been modified in the Pike release:

    * The property ``img_hide_hypervisor_id`` has been added to the namespace
      ``OS::Compute::LibvirtImage``.

    * Several `new values`_ were added for the ``vmware_ostype`` property in
      the ``OS::Compute::VMware`` namespace.

    You may upgrade these definitions using:

    ``glance-manage db load_metadefs [--path <path>] [--merge] [--prefer_new]``
