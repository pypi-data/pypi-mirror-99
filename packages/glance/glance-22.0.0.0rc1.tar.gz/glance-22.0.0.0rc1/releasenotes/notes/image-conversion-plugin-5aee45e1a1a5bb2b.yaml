    Automatic image conversion plugin for Interoperable Image Import. With
    this release operators can specify target image format and get all images
    created via the Image Import methods introduced in the Images API v2.6
    converted automatically to that format. The feautre uses qemu-img under
    the hood which limits the source image formats that users can upload. Any
    image that fails the conversion when this plugin is enabled will fail the
    image creation.
