    Policy enforcement for several Metadata Definition delete APIs are
    added in this release. The following actions are enforced
    and added to the policy.json:

    - ``delete_metadef_namespace``
    - ``delete_metadef_object``
    - ``remove_metadef_resource_type_association``
    - ``remove_metadef_property``
    - ``delete_metadef_tag``
    - ``delete_metadef_tags``

    This prevents roles that should not have access to these APIs from
    performing the APIs associated with the actions above.
