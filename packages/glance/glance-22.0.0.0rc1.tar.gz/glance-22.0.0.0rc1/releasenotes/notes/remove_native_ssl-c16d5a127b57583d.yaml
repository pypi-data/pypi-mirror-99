upgrade:

    If upgrade is conducted from PY27 where ssl connections has been terminated
    into glance-api, the termination needs to happen externally from now on.
security:
  - |
    The ssl support from Glance has been removed as it worked only under PY27
    which is not anymore supported environment. Termination of encrypted
    connections needs to happen externally as soon as move to PY3 happens. Any
    deployment needing end to end encryption would need to put either reverse
    proxy (using fully blown http server like Apache or Nginx will cause
    significant performance hit and we advice using something more simple that
    does not break the http protocol) in front of the service or utilize
    ssl tunneling (like stunnel) between loadbalancers and glance-api.
