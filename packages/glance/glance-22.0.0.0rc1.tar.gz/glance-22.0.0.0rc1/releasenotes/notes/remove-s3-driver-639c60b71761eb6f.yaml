prelude: >
  - The ``s3`` store driver has been removed.
upgrade:
  - The latest release of glance_store library does not have
    the support for the ``s3`` driver. All code references
    of the same have been removed from the library. As this
    release of Glance uses the updated glance_store library,
    you will find the ``s3`` driver support removed from
    Glance too. For example the Glance image location
    strategy modules no longer offer the ``s3`` driver
    support.
