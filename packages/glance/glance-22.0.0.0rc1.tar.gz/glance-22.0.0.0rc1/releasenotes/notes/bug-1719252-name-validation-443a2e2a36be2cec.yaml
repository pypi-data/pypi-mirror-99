    The metadefs schemas for 'property', 'properties', 'tag', 'tags',
    'object', and 'objects' previously specified a 'name' element of maximum
    255 characters.  Any attempt to add a name of greater than 80 characters
    in length, however, resulted in a 500 response. The schemas have been
    corrected to specify a maximum length of 80 characters for the 'name'
    field.
