    An **EXPERIMENTAL** version of the Images API supplied by Glance
    is introduced as **2.6**.  It includes the new API calls introduced
    for the `refactored image import`_ functionality.  This functionality
    is **not** enabled by default, so the CURRENT version of the Images
    API remains at 2.5.  There are no changes to the version 2.5 API in
    this release, so all version 2.5 calls will work whether or not the
    new import functionality is enabled or not.

    The version 2.6 API is being introduced as EXPERIMENTAL because it
    is a Minimal Viable Product delivery of the functionality described
    in the `refactored image import`_ specification.  As an MVP, the
    responses described in that specification are abbreviated in version
    2.6.  It is expected that version 2.6 will be completed in Queens,
    but at this time, we encourage operators to try out the new
    functionality, but keep in mind its EXPERIMENTAL nature.
