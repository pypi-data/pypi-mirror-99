upgrade:
  - The ``owner_is_tenant`` configuration option, which was deprecated in
    Rocky, has been removed in this release.  As announced in the spec
    `Deprecate owner_is_tenant
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/implemented/glance/spec-lite-deprecate-owner_is_tenant.html>`_,
    given that an operator survey indicated that this option was only
    used in its default value of ``True``, no database migration is
    included in this release.
