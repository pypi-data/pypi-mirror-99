upgrade:
  - A recent change to oslo.log (>= 3.17.0) set the default value
    of ``[DEFAULT]/use_stderr`` to ``False`` in order to prevent
    duplication of logs (as reported in bug \#1588051). Since this
    would change the current behaviour of certain glance commands
    (e.g., glance-replicator, glance-cache-manage, etc.), we chose to
    override the default value of ``use_stderr`` to ``True`` in those
    commands. We also chose not to override that value in any Glance
    service (e.g., glance-api, glance-registry) so that duplicate
    logs are not created by those services. Operators that have a
    usecase that relies on logs being reported on standard error may
    set ``[DEFAULT]/use_stderr = True`` in the appropriate service's
    configuration file upon deployment.
