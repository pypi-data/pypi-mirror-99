features:
  - Implement the ability to filter images by the properties `id`,
    `name`, `status`,`container_format`, `disk_format` using the 'in'
    operator between the values.
    Following the pattern of existing filters, new filters are specified as
    query parameters using the field to filter as the key and the filter
    criteria as the value in the parameter.
    Filtering based on the principle of full compliance with the template,
    for example 'name = in:deb' does not match 'debian'.
    Changes apply exclusively to the API v2 Image entity listings
    An example of an acceptance criteria using the 'in' operator for name
    ?name=in:name1,name2,name3.
    These filters were added using syntax that conforms to the latest
    guidelines from the OpenStack API Working Group.
