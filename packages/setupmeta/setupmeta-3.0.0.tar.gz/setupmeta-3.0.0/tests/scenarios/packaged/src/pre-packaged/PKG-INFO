        # Project description

        This scenario simulates a PKG, with no git source available.

        During testing, `src/pre-packaged` is renamed to `src/pre_packaged.egg-info`,
        which will simulate a pip-expanded tarball + running of `setup.py egg_info`.

        This simulates how setupmeta behaves in such an environment.
