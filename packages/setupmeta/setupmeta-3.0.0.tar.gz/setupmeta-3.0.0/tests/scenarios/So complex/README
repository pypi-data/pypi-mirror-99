My cplx-nm_here - Sample complex project

README is a regular txt file
.. [[include HISTORY.txt]]
Done with README.
.. [[end long_description]]

Everything below will not make it to long_description

This project is trying hard to be as edge-casey as possible.

No README.rst here, long description is still found in this "README" however

Other peculiarities of this example:
- __title__ is used instead of name= in setup.py
- there's a space in the folder name, as well as the `name` intended for pypi
- only part of this README is included, as well as part of HISTORY.txt
- there's a package in complex/ as well as src/complex/
- `version` is defined 3 times
- `keywords` is defined everywhere, the setup.py docstring (first found) wins
- there's an `author`, `contact`, and `maintainer`
- `maintainer` is defined twice
- `url` is auto-filled with package name
- `download_url` is auto-filled from a relative path
- there's an explicit `extras_require`
- `classifiers` is mentioned explicitly, as well as in `classifiers.txt` file
- `license` is mentioned explicitly, as well as in `LICENSE.md` file
- there's an `entry_points.ini`
- there's a `pinned.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
- nested requirements via `-r` in `requirements-dev.txt`, one creating a circular reference, another one pointing to a non-existing file
