Description: # MotionBotList
        Interact with motion botlist with python scripts.
        
        # Examples on host to use
        Here is a quick example on how you can update your bots status.
        ```py
        import MotionBotList
        
        bot_list = MotionBotList.connect("your_api_key")
        
        bot_list.update(bot_id, server_count) # Add your bots data here
        ```
        Run the script and your bots status should be updated. If there was a error there will be a exception. To handle excaption you could do the following:
        ```py
        import MotionBotList
        from MotionBotList import Exceptions
        
        bot_list = MotionBotList.connect("your_api_key")
        
        try:
          bot_list.update(bot_id, server_count)
        except Exceptions.Forbidden:
          print("You don't have access to update your status, invailid token or wrong bot")
        except Exceptions.BotNotFound:
          print("The bot ID was invailed")
        except Exception as error:
          print(error)
        ```
        ## Get a bots info
        With this function you can get all data from a bot
        ```py
        import MotionBotList
        
        bot_list = MotionBotList.connect("your_api_key")
        
        bot = bot_list.get_bot(bot_id)
        print(bot.name)
        print(bot.owner_id)
        ```
        This function will return a bot object, or None if you don't have a API key. This function will raise the `BotNotFound` exception if not bot was found
        ## Get bot votes
        Get all users who voted for the bot
        ```py
        import MotionBotList
        
        bot_list = MotionBotList.connect("your_api_key")
        
        votes = bot_list.get_votes(bot_id)
        
        for user in votes:
            print(user.user_name)
            print(user.vote_time)
        ```
        Will return a list with a `voteuser` object.

        ## Voting system
        A short description on how our voting system works.
        
        Every beginning of a month we reset all votes, if user vote on that day their vote will stay on the bots page until the beggining of the next month. A user can vote once every 12 hours, their vote will be removed from the list and will be replaced with a place holder. This is when we set the `is_user` to `false`.
