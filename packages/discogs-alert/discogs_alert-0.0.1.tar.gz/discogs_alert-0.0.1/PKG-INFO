# discogs alert
Customised, real-time alerting for your discogs wantlist. This app allows you to set up a fine-grained 
alerting system for your wantlist on Discogs. You can configure different tiers of priority for your
wantlist items, customize the notification protocol, and sync directly from your Discogs watchlist 
to easily search for releases. 

You can configure notifications in the following categories:
- `notify_on_sight`: get a notification as soon as a release goes on sale in the marketplace
- `notify_below_threshold`:  get notified if a particular release goes on sale below a certain price

as well as set up a number of different per-release filters (media/sleeve condition, maximum price, 
seller location) to completely customize the notifications you wish to receive. Finally, you can 
configure notifications to be sent in a number of different ways: push notifications, email, and 
slack are all supported in version 1.0.
