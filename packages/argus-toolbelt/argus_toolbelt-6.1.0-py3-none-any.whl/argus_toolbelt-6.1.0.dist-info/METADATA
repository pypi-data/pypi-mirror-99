Argus Toolbelt
==============
Argus Toolbelt is a framework for unifying commandline tools to interact with
Argus under one command. This framework also makes it easy for others to develop
their own commands with a simple pythonic interface.

While any command can be made, Argus is also a first class citizen, meaning that
a command developer won't have to deal with auth and HTTP requests.


Usage
------------
As with most other packages, Argus Toolbelt is available on PyPi.

```bash
pip install argus-toolbelt
```

After the package has been installed, it can be ran as `argus-cli` on the
commandline. You'll find 

For a full list of commands, try: 

```bash
argus-cli --help
```

If you for example want to check statistics for all cases, you can write:

```bash
argus-cli cases statistics
```

Development
-----------
This repository is using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as it's dependency
system, meaning it has to be installed on your system first.

```bash
pip install poetry
```

To install this repository use: 

```bash
poetry install
```

Now you should be able to run with: 
```bash
poetry run argus-cli
```
