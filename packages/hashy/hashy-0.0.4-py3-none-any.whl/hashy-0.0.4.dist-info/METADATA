# hashy

Another hash library.

hashy provides an md5, sha256 or sha512 for string, file, dict, list and set.

String and file hashes are conventional and can be compared to other implementations. For example
you can go to an online hash calculator for "a" and get the same hash as hashy generates.

Hashes for complex data types like dict, list and set are specific to hashy.

# Example

```

from hashy import get_string_sha256

print(get_string_sha256("a"))

# prints
# ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b39a23dc4da786eff8147c4e72b9807785afee48bb

```
