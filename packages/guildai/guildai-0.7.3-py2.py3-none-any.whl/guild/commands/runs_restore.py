    Runs are restored using `RUN` arguments. If a `RUN` argument is
    not specified, all runs matching the filter criteria are
    restored. See SPECIFYING RUNS and FILTERING topics for more
    information.

    Use ``guild runs list --deleted`` for a list of runs that can be
    restored.

    By default, Guild will display the list of runs to be restored and
    ask you to confirm the operation. If you want to restore the runs
    without being prompted, use the ``--yes`` option.

    If a `RUN` argument is not specified, ``:`` is assumed (all runs
    are selected).

    ### Restore Remote Runs

    If a run has been deleted remotely, you can restore it using
    `--remote` provided the remote type supports this feature.
