    `URL` is downloaded as a Guild resource in the current

    exactly as used in this command. Guild will treat any changes as a
    different resource.

    **IMPORTANT:** Independently verify SHA 256 digests for downloaded
    resources, especially those that will be executed, including
    Python libraries.

    Existing resources are not re-downloaded. To force a resource to
    be re-downloaded, delete the resource file and run `download`
    again.
