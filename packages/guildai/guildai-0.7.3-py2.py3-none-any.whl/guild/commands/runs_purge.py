    **WARNING**: Purged runs cannot be recovered!

    Runs are purged (i.e. permanently deleted) by specifying `RUN`
    arguments. If a `RUN` argument is not specified, all runs matching
    the filter criteria are purged. See SPECIFYING RUNS and FILTERING
    topics for more information on how runs are selected.

    Use ``guild runs list --deleted`` for a list of runs that can be
    purged.

    By default, Guild will display the list of runs to be purged and
    ask you to confirm the operation. If you want to purge the runs
    without being prompted, use the ``--yes`` option.

    **WARNING**: Take care when purging runs using indexes as the runs
    selected with indexes can change. Review the list of runs
    carefully before confirming a purge operation.

    {{ runs_support.runs_arg }}

    If a `RUN` argument is not specified, ``:`` is assumed (all runs
    are selected).

    {{ runs_support.all_filters }}

    ### Permanently Delete Remote Runs

    If a run has been deleted remotely, you can permanently delete it
    using `--remote` provided the remote type supports deleted run
    recovery.
