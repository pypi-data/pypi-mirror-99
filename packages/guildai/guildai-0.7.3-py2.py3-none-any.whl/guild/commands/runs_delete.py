    Runs are deleting by specifying `RUN` arguments. If a `RUN`
    argument is not specified, all runs matching the filter criteria
    are deleted. See SPECIFYING RUNS and FILTERING topics for more
    information on how runs are selected.

    By default, Guild will display the list of runs to be deleted and
    ask you to confirm the operation. If you want to delete the runs
    without being prompted, use the ``--yes`` option.

    **WARNING**: Take care when deleting runs using indexes as the
    runs selected with indexes can change. Review the list of runs
    carefully before confirming a delete operation.

    If a run is still running, Guild will stop it first before
    deleting it.

    If you delete a run by mistake, provided you didn't use the
    ``--permanent`` option, you can restore it using ``guild runs
    restore``.

    If you want to permanently delete runs, use the ``--permanent``
    option.

    **WARNING**: Permanentaly deleted runs cannot be restored.

    {{ runs_support.runs_arg }}

    If a `RUN` argument is not specified, ``:`` is assumed (all runs
    are selected).

    ### Delete Remote Runs

    To delete runs on a remote, use `--remote`.
