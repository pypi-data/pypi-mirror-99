    """Visualize runs with TensorBoard.

    This command will start a TensorBoard process and open a browser
    window for you. TensorBoard will show the views that are selected
    using the commands filters. This list corresponds to the the runs
    shown when running ``guild runs``.

    This command will not exit until you type ``Ctrl-c`` to stop it.

    If you'd like to change the filters used to select runs, stop the
    command and re-run it with a different set of filters. You may
    alternatively start another instance of TensorBoard in a separate
    console.

    TensorBoard will automatically refresh with the current run data.

    If you're prefer that Guild not open a browser window, run the
    command with the `--no-open` option.

    By default, Guild will start the TensorBoard process on a randomly
    selected free port. If you'd like to specify the port that
    TensorBoard runs on, use the `--port` option.

    Guild will not include batch runs by default. To include batch
    runs, use `--include-batch`.
