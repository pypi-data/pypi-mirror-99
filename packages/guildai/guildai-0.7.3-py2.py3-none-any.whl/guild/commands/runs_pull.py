    `RUN` must be the complete run ID of the remote run.

    **NOTE:** Guild does not currently support listing remote runs. To
    pull specific runs, query the remote server for the full run ID of
    each run you want to pull.

    You may alternatively use `--all` to pull all remote runs. If
    `--all` is specified, `RUN` arguments cannot be specified.

    `--verbose` is always enabled when `--all` is specified.

    `REMOTE` must be define in ``~/.guild/config.yml``. See REMOTES
    below for more information.

    By default Guild will prompt you before copying. If you want to
    apply the changes without being prompted, use the ``--yes``
    option.
