"""
This class works as an interface to code any module within MindsDB
We use this to standarize the way that code parts of what makes mindsDB in a way such that those can be replaced so long the interfaces remain

The principle is very simple, all you need within the module is set in the method __call__

whatever you pass to call is the input and whatever it returns is the ourput of the module

The interesting part is that in a module you should not instantiate data sources or any global resources
Those should be available via self.session
