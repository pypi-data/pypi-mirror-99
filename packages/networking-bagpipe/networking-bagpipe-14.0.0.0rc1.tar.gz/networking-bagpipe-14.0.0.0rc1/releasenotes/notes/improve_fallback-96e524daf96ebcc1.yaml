    The IPVPN bgpvpn/router fallback mechanism has been improved. This
    mechanism allows traffic not matching any VRF route in the distributed
    BGPVPN implementation of bagpipe, to "fallback" and reach a Neutron
    router connected on the network. The implementation has been simplified
    and the risk removed of not reaching VRF destinations because of a stale
    ARP entry for the gateway IP.  This improvement comes with the requirement
    of using the OpenVSwitch security group firewall driver on
    any node having both the l3agent and VMs with a need to reach BGPVPN
    destinations (e.g. single node setup or DVR setup).
