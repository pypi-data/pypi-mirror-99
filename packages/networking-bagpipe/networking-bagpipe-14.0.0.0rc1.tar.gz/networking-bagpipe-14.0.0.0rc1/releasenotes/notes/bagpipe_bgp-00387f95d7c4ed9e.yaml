    This release integrates BaGPipe-BGP: rather than depending on the old
    bagpipe-bgp version found on github, the recent version of this
    component is developped in the networking_bagpipe package itself. This
    version has been adapted to leverage Openstack libraries for logging,
    configuration, driver loading, and only rely on packages found in generic
    Openstack requirements
