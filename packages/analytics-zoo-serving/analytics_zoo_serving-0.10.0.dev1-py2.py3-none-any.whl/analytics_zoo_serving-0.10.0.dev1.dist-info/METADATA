Analytics Zoo: A unified Data Analytics and AI platform for distributed TensorFlow,
 Keras, PyTorch, Apache Spark/Flink and Ray.

You may want to develop your AI solutions using Analytics Zoo if:

- You want to easily prototype the entire end-to-end pipeline that applies AI models
 (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, BigDL, OpenVINO, etc.) to production big data.
- You want to transparently scale your AI applications from a laptop to large clusters with "zero"
 code changes.
- You want to deploy your AI pipelines to existing YARN or K8S clusters *WITHOUT* any modifications
 to the clusters.
- You want to automate the process of applying machine learning (such as feature engineering,
 hyperparameter tuning, model selection and distributed inference).
