Description: SoMeWeTa
        ========
        
        SoMeWeTa (short for Social Media and Web Tagger) is a part-of-speech
        tagger that supports domain adaptation and that can incorporate
        external sources of information such as Brown clusters and lexica. It
        is based on the averaged structured perceptron and uses beam search
        and an early update strategy. It is possible to train and evaluate the
        tagger on partially annotated data.
        
        SoMeWeTa achieves state-of-the-art results on the German web and
        social media texts from the `EmpiriST 2015 shared task
        <https://sites.google.com/site/empirist2015/>`_ on automatic
        linguistic annotation of computer-mediated communication / social
        media. Therefore, SoMeWeTa is particularly well-suited to tag all
        kinds of written German discourse, for example chats, forums, wiki
        talk pages, tweets, blog comments, social networks, SMS and WhatsApp
        dialogues.
        
        In addition, we also provide models trained on German, English and
        French newspaper texts, as well as models for Bhojpuri and spoken
        Italian. For all languages, SoMeWeTa achieves highly competitive
        results close to the current state of the art.
