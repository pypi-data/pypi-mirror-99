Glue in Jupyter
===============

About
-----

The **glue-jupyter** package provides a way to use the `glue
<http://glueviz.org/>`_ package for multi-dimensional linked-data exploration in
the `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebook and Jupyter Lab. This package is
still in early development, but it is already possible to try out some of the
functionality. If you run into any issues or would like to request features,
please head over to our `issue tracker
<https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-jupyter/issues>`_.

In addition to the user guide above, we provide several example notebooks that
can be run online without having to install glue-jupyter on your computer (these
run on https://mybinder.org/):

* `Investigating star formation in the W5 region <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glue-viz/glue-jupyter/master?filepath=notebooks%2FAstronomy%2FW5%2FW5%20Tutorial.ipynb>`__ (example with linking a table and an image)
* `Exploring the L1448 data in 3D <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glue-viz/glue-jupyter/master?filepath=notebooks%2FAstronomy%2FL1448%2FL1448%20in%203D.ipynb>`__ (example of 3D volume rendering)
* `Visualizing flight paths in the Boston area <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glue-viz/glue-jupyter/master?filepath=notebooks%2FPlanes%2FBoston%20Planes.ipynb>`__ (example with a single tabular dataset)
