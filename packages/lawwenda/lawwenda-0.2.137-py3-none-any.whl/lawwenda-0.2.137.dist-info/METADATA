About
=====

Lawwenda provides access to a directory in your filesystem by means of
a web interface. Users can navigate to it with any modern web browser
and see your files.

For real usage (i.e. "production systems") it is hosted in a *wsgi*
compatible web server. This is a very common standard for hosting
Python web applications and is supported by most widespread web server
daemons.

The most noteworthy features are:

* Comfortable web browser interface that lists the files and
  subdirectories in a directory, shows some details of them, and
  allows to open (i.e. "download") them; in a similar way to usual
  desktop file managers.

* Can be either read-only or also with write access, i.e. uploading,
  renaming, moving, deleting data.

* Can be password protected or not. In the latter case, your web
  server may put another authentication method around it.

* Supports some "modern" file attributes like a comment, tags, a
  rating and a geographic position; backed by "extended attributes" on
  file system level.

* A configuration specifies one or many "shares" (or none), each one
  potentially pointing to another directory and with an individual
  setup (incl. individual passwords).

* Shares can have file exclude criteria (path patterns, tags, ...).

* Shares can have expiration dates.

* User interface works fine on desktop machines and mobile phones.

* Alternatively to the web browser interface, users can connect to a
  share with a WebDAV client or compatible file manager (modern file
  managers should be compatible).

* Extensible by plugging in custom Python modules, with a friendly,
  rich and well documented api.

* Thoroughly designed with security in mind.

lawwenda is in alpha state.


Dependencies
============

There are external parts that are used by lawwenda. Many thanks to the
projects and all participants. Some installation methods might handle
dependency installation automatically, while others leave that up to
you.

Introduction
============

Please read how to make Lawwenda ready for the first steps in
Appendix: Installation.


First Steps
-----------

In order to make any use of Lawwenda, it is required to create at
least one file share. This can be done by executing this on a
terminal:

   lawwenda_cli add_share myshare /path/that/i/want/to/share

This assumes */path/that/i/want/to/share* to be the directory you want
to share. *myshare* is the share name and can be chosen freely. It
will ask you to choose a password (just leave empty for no password).

Then you need a web server that hosts your Lawwenda installation. If
you have skipped this part of Appendix: Installation, you can get one
by executing this:

   lawwenda_cli run_dev_server

This will print the root address of a tiny local web server that hosts
your Lawwenda installation for the moment. It will not answer anything
useful, but you need it in the following step in order to access your
shares.

Warning:

  Be aware that starting this server potentially makes data available
  to parties that should not have access (e.g. if 3rd parties have
  access to your local network services). In any case, for different
  reasons, do not use this variant for more than some trying, testing,
  developing!

If your web server provides your Lawwenda installation at
*https://example.com/shares/*, you can access your new *myshare* share
at *https://example.com/shares/myshare/*. The base address might be
anything, and just the share name has to be appended.

There are some optional parameters that can be specified in a
*lawwenda_cli add_share* call. They are a large part of Lawwenda's
versatility. Get more details by executing:

   lawwenda_cli add_share -h

Once you have Lawwenda running in a web server and you have added at
least one share, you can browse to its share url and start using it.
Read the User Interface Quickstart Guide for more details about the
user interface.


Appendix: Installation
======================

Install Lawwenda via the installation package for your environment, if
a suitable one exists for download. This also takes care of installing
dependencies and doing preparation (unless mentioned otherwise in the
installation procedure). It is possible (and not hard) to use the bare
Source Package, but beyond this documentation.

For real usage it is highly recommended to host Lawwenda in a real web
server. This makes use of the *wsgi* interface, which is commonly used
for hosting Python based web application. You can skip this for now at
come back somewhat later if you just want to try it out, and make the
First Steps.

The exact steps for adding a wsgi application to a web server depend
on the daemon that is used. Please read the documentation of your web
server.

You will need to specify the location of a wsgi script during
configuration. Create this file in a place that is convenient for you
and fill it with the content that is printed by this command line:

   lawwenda_cli generate_wsgi

For example, the steps for Apache 2.4 are roughly the following:

* Install and enable *mod_wsgi*.

* Add a snippet like this inside some *VirtualHost* in your Apache
  configuration:

     WSGIScriptAlias /shares /srv/lawwenda/lawwenda.wsgi
     <Directory /srv/lawwenda>
         Require all granted
     </Directory>

  The */shares* path is the path segment to append to the VirtualHost
  root url in order to reach Lawwenda. That url might then be
  *https://example.com/shares*. Note that this url will not return a
  useful answer. This is okay, the documentation will explain why.

  The */srv/lawwenda/lawwenda.wsgi* path (and its parent path in
  *Directory*) can be chosen freely. This file will be created in the
  next step. The following assumes the paths as in the snippet.

* Execute this commands on a terminal:

     mkdir -p /srv/lawwenda
     lawwenda_cli generate_wsgi > /srv/lawwenda/lawwenda.wsgi

* Adapt as needed to match your security requirements. :)

* Restart Apache.

Note:

  The web server must be privileged to access the directories that you
  are going to share.
