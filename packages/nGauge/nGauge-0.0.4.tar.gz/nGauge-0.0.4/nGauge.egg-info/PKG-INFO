Description: # nGauge
        `nGauge` is a Python library which provides a collection of tools for the measurement, quantification, and visualization of neuron morphology. The library structure makes automation of data analysis pipelines easier, leading to faster and more reproducible results.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### To install with `pip` on a `python 3.x` installation:
        
        `pip install ngauge`
        
        See repository information here: <https://pypi.org/project/nGauge/>
        
        ### To install from source:
        
        `pip install .`
        
        ### Using with Blender
        
        By default, many versions (such as the version packaged with Ubuntu) of Blender
        support packages installed to the system Python library; in this case, no additional
        steps are required.
        
        For Blender versions which do not share Python with the system-level install (such
        as Windows and `snap` versions) can be used with one of these two methods:
        
        1. If the Python version of the system and Blender are the same, the system
        library path can be appended to the Blender path (`import sys; sys.path += ['<location>']`).
        2. It is also possible to directly install packages to the Blender Python libary
        using `pip`, however support for this install method can not be provided.
          * For example, please see: `https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/56011/how-to-install-pip-for-blenders-bundled-python`.
