"""This module contains the classes which pass on database functionality

Note on terminology:
    In ixdat, we seek to use the following naming conventions:
        `load` grabs *an object* from a database backend given its class or table name
            and the name of the specific object desired (see DataBase.load).
        `load_xxx` grabs `xxx` from a database backend given the object for which
            xxx is desired (see DataBase.load_object_data).
        `get` grabs *an object* from a database backend given its class or table name and
            the princple key (the id) of the row in the corresponding table
        `get_xxx` grabs `xxx` from a database backend given the principle key (the id) of
            the row in the table corresponding to xxx (see `Database.get`)

        So `load` works by `name` or existing object, while `get` works by `id`.
        `get_xx` is also used as the counterpart to `set_xx` to grab `xx`, typically a
        managed attribute, from an object in memory.

        `load` and `get` convention holds vertically - i.e. the Backend, the DataBase,
            up through the Saveable parent class for all ixdat classes corresponding to
            database tables have `load` and `get` methods which call downwards.

    This enables seamless interoperability between database tables and ixdat classes.
    Classes inheriting from this need to provide just a bit of info to define the
    corresponding table, and then saving and loading should just work.

    At a minimum, the `table_name` and `column_attrs` class attributes need to be
    overwritten in inheriting classes to define the name and columns of the main
    corresponding table. If an auxiliary table is needed to store lists of references
    as rows, this should be represented in `linkers`. Sub-sub classes can use
    `extra_column_attrs` to add extra columns via an auxiliary table without changing
    the main table name.

    ixdat is lazy, only loading things when needed. Correspondingly, all of the columns
    of table mentioned above should refer to (lists of) id's and not actual objects of
    other ixdat classes.

    The class attributes (defined before __init__) and object attributes (defined in
    __init__) are described here. See the other methods and the relevant inheriting
    classes for more info.

    Class attributes:
        db (DataBase): the database, DB, which has the save, get, and load_data methods
        table_name (str): The name of the table or folder in which objects are saved
        column_attrs (set of str): {attr} where attr is the name of the column in the
            table and also the name of the attribute of the class.
        extra_column_attrs (dict): {table_name: {attr}} for auxiliary tables
            to represent the "extra" attributes, for double-inheriting classes.
        linkers (dict): {table_name: (reference_table, attr)} for defining
            the connections between objects.

    Object attributes:
        backend (Backend): the backend where the object is saved. For a
            new, un-saved, object, this is "memory".
        _id (int): the principle key of the object, also accessible as `id`. This should
            be set explicitly in the backend when loading an object. For objects
            initiated directly in the session, it will become the id provided by the
            memory backend, which just counts objects of each table starting with 1.
            TODO: consider renaming.
                See: https://github.com/ixdat/ixdat/pull/1#discussion_r546434676
        name (str): The name of the object. `name` should be a column in ixdat tables.
