``ixdat``: The In-situ Experimental Data Tool
=============================================

``ixdat`` will provide a powerful **object-oriented** interface to experimental data, especially in-situ experimental data for which it is of interest to combine data obtained simultaneously from multiple techniques.

``ixdat`` will replace the existing electrochemistry - mass spectrometry data tool, `EC_MS <https://github.com/ScottSoren/EC_MS>`_, and will thus become a powerful stand-alone tool for analysis and visualization of data acquired by the equipment of `Spectro Inlets <https://spectroinlets.com>`_ and other EC-MS solutions.
It will also replace the existing electrochemistry - synchrotron GIXRD data tool, `EC_Xray <https://github.com/ScottSoren/EC_Xray>`_ when needed.
Over time, it will acquire functionality for more and more techniques.

In addition to a **pluggable** parser interface for importing your data format, it will include pluggable exporters and plotters, as well as a database interface.

We will update this README as features are added. More importantly, we will document this project as we develop it here: https://ixdat.readthedocs.io/

``ixdat`` is free and open source software and we welcome input and new collaborators.
