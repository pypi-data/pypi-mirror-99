2021-03: version 40.1
* Adjust entrypoint.sh template to ensure resilient-circuits is restarted when a fatal error occurs when running on App Host
* Added timestamp to logs on App Host

2021-02: ver. 40.0
* The function template that is produced when you run 'codegen' now includes references to the resilient-lib library.
* When the var RES_SDK_DEV is set, 'codegen' now creates the payload_samples directory with JSON examples for the Resilient UI and mock results for a "mock server".
* Added '--no-samples' flag to 'package' and when set do not look for the payload_samples directory or try add them to the export.res file.
* Added '--image-hash' flag to 'package' to specify the SHA256 of an image that the app.zip refers to.

2020-10: ver. 39.0
* The 'docgen' command creates a single README and updated the README to include information on App Hosts.
* Added the Resilient platform version to the customize.py template.
* The 'package' command replaces tags on Resilient objects in export.res instead of extending them.
* Added environmental variable RES_SDK_DEV.
* Added '--set-version' argument to the dev command.
* Added 'display_name' attribute to the setup.py file.
* The 'codegen', 'codegen --reload' and 'dev --set-version' commands create a /util/data/export.res file that contains the import definition which was previously base64 encoded text in customize.py.
* Before running the 'codegen --reload' on packages created with Resilient SDK < 39.0.0, ensure the MANIFEST.in file includes the line: recursive-include <package_name>/util *
* The 'codegen' and 'package' commands return errors if the package name contains uppercase characters.
* Added a 'clone' command to clone an Action Object.
