## Documentation
For details on the Resilient SDK commands, use the `-h` option on the command line. For example, `resilient-sdk -h` and `resilient-sdk codegen -h`.

The Resilient App Developer's Guide provides information on using the Resilient SDK to develop and package apps. The guide is available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs). On this web page, select your Resilient platform version.
