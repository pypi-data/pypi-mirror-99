        Moth ... Messages Organized by Topic Headers
           (en français: Messages organisés par thème hierarchique. )

        A multi-protocol library for use by hierarchical message passing implementations,
        (messages which have a 'topic' header that is used for routing by brokers.)
 
       - regardless of protocol, the message format returned should be the same.
       - the message is turned into a python dictionary, corresponding to key-value pairs
         in the message body, and properties.
       - topic is special key that may end up in the message body, or some sort of property
         or metadata.
       - the protocol should support acknowledgement under user control. Such control indicated
         by the presence of an entry_point called "ack". The entry point accepts "ack_id" as
         a message identifier to be passed to the broker.  Whatever protocol symbol is used
         by the protocol, it is passed through this message property.  Examples:
         in rabbitmq/amqp ack takes a "delivery_tag" as an argument, in MQTT, it takes a "message-id"
         so when receiving an AMQP message, the m['ack_id'] is assigned the delivery_tag from the message. 
       - There is a special dict item:  "_DeleteOnPost",  
         to identify keys which are added only for local use.
         they will be removed from the message when publishing.
         examples:  topic (sent outside body), message-id (used for acknowledgements.)
                    new_basedir, ack_id, new_... (settings...)

     intent is to be specialized for topic based data distribution (MQTT style.)
     API to allow pass-through of protocol specific properties, but apply templates for genericity.

     Target protocols (and corresponding libraries.): AMQP, MQTT, ?

     Things to specify:
  	broker
	topicPrefix
        subTopic  
        id   (queue for amqp, id for mqtt)

  this library knows nothing about Sarracenia, the only code used from sarracenia is to interpret
  duration properties, from the root sarra/__init__.py
  
  usage:
     c= Moth( broker, True, '5m', { 'batch':1 } )

     c.newMessages()
       - if there are new messages from a publisher, return them, otherwise return
         an empty list []].
       
     p=Moth( broker, True, '5m', { 'batch':1 }, True )
     p.putNewMessage()

     p.close()
       - tear down connection.     
  

       initialize a broker connection. Connections are unidirectional.
       either for subscribing (with subFactory) or publishing (with pubFactory.)
       
       the factories return objects subclassed to match the protocol required
       by the broker argument.

       arguments to the factories are:

       broker ... the url of the broker to connect to.
       props is a dictionary or properties/parameters.
       supplied as overrides to the default properties listed above.

       Some may vary among protocols.

       Protocol     library implementing    URL to select
       --------     --------------------    -------------

       AMQPv0.9 --> amqplib from Celery --> amqp, amqps
       AMQPv0.9 --> pika                --> pika, pikas
       MQTTv3   --> paho                --> mqtt, mqtts
       AMQPv1.0 --> qpid-proton         --> amq1, amq1s



       messaging_strategy:
        how to manage the connection. Covers whether to treat the connection
        as new or assume it is set up. Also, If something goes wrong.  
        What should be done. 
         
       reset:
         on startup... erase any state, and re-initialize.

       stubborn:  
         if set to True, loop forever if something bad happens.  Never give up.
         This sort of setting is desired in operations, especially unattended.
 
         if set to False, may give up more easily.

       failure_duration is to advise library how to structure connection service level.
          
       5m - make a connection that will recover from transient errors of a few minutes,
            but not tax the broker too much for prolonged outages.

       5d    - duration outage to striving to survive connection for five days.

       Changing recovery_strategy setting, might result in having to destroy and re-create 
       consumer queues (AMQP.)
