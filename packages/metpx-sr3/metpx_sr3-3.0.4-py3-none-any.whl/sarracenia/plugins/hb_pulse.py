"""
  if pulse is emitted for a while, and then missing,
  we will issue a reconnection.

  caveat 1 : once pulsing has started... it must continue
             if poll_pulse stops the process will verify the connection,
                  (is_alive) and if that fails, trigger a reconnection
             every heartbeat

  caveat 2 : receiving pulse messages will not behave as expected for
             process with N instances because we cannot guarantee that each
             one of them receives its own pulse...

  because of caveat #2, the pulse frequency should be reasonably high... once a minute?
  but in the case of caveat #2, you only need multiple instances if the flow is too high for one.
  so maybe this is never a problem?  would be a problem if flows are extremely uneven (high for short periods.)
