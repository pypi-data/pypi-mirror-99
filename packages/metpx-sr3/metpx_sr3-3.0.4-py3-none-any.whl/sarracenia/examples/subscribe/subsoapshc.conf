# Sample subscribe config, used in conjunction with pollsoapshc.conf to download
# hydrometric data files from SHC's SOAP web service. To use, make sure rabbitmq is 
# running as described in the Dev.rst documentation, and a tsource user/xs_tsource and 
# xpublic exchanges exist, with FLOWBROKER set to the hostname rabbitmq is running on 
# (e.g. export FLOWBROKER='localhost'). The directory option can be changed to specify 
# where the files are being downloaded. (HYDRO_DATA also needs to be specified before running).
