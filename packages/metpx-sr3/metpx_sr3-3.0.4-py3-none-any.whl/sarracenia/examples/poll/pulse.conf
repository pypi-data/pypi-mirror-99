# Initial pulse emitting configuration, by sr_audit, tune to taste. 
# Pulses are messages to sent to all subscribers to verify that broker and subscriber are connecting.
# For a client that only downloads data rarely, getting pulses is what confirms they are still connected.
# Receivers count the pulses received, and the hb_pulse plugin tallies the ones received to decide whether 
# re-connecting to the broker is necessary.
# 
# To suppress pulsing:
#       sr_poll stop pulse
#       sr_poll disable pulse
