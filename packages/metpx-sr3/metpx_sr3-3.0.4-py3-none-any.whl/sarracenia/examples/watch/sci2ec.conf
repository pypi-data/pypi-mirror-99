# this watch should be running on either a protocol node or a ppp node.
# ~/sci2ec should be symlinked to a site1 data file system, or just a plain directory in home.
# a subscriber running on an ECCC machine will recieve advertisements from this watch, and copy
# the files to somewhere in cmc.ec.gc.ca 
#
# force_polling is necessary because a single node will not reliably see modifications made on other nodes.
# when cluster file systems (in this case: GPFS) are in use.
