Django InformixDB
==================

A database driver for Django to connect to an Informix database via pyodbc.

**Some limitations**:

- Does not support default values
- Informix automatically creates indexes on foreign keys, but Django attempts to do that
  manually; the current implementation here just attempts to catch the error on index
  creation. It may unintentionally catch other index creation errors where the index
  already exists.


Configure local environment
---------------------------

The following environment variables should exist:

INFORMIXDIR
    The path to the Informix client install directory

INFORMIXSERVER
    The name of the Informix service to which we need to connect

INFORMIXSQLHOSTS
    The path to the ``sqlhosts`` file that the Informix driver should use

LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    The path(s) to the various Informix library files: Usually
    ``$INFORIMIXDIR/lib:$INFORMIXDIR/lib/cli:$IMFORMIXDIR/lib/esql``

DB_LOCALE
    In case of ``Database locale information mismatch.`` error during connection,
    you should specify your database locale, e.g. ``DB_LOCALE=en_US.8859-15``

You will also need to add an entry within your ``sqlhosts`` file for each remote/local Informix
server connection in the following format::

    <INFORMIX_SERVER_NAME>    onsoctcp     <INFORMIX_HOST_NAME>    <INFORMIX_SERVICE_NAME>

For example::

    dev    onsoctcp    localhost    9088

You may alternatively use a symbolic name in that line in place of the port number, typically ``sqlexec`` and
then configure the port number in the ``/etc/services`` file::

    sqlexec    9088/tcp


Configure settings.py
---------------------

Djangoâ€™s settings.py uses the following to connect to an Informix database:

.. code-block:: python

    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django_informixdb',
        'NAME': 'myproject',
        'SERVER': 'ifxserver',
        'USER' : 'testuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'passw0rd',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'DRIVER': '/path/to/iclit09b.so'. # Or iclit09b.dylib on macOS
            'CPTIMEOUT': 120,
            'CONN_TIMEOUT': 120,
            'ISOLATION_LEVEL': 'READ_UNCOMMITTED',
            'LOCK_MODE_WAIT': 0,
            'VALIDATE_CONNECTION': True,
        },
        'CONNECTION_RETRY': {
            'MAX_ATTEMPTS': 10,
        },
        'TEST': {
            'NAME': 'myproject',
            'CREATE_DB': False
        }
    }

CPTIMEOUT
    This will set connection pooling timeout.
    Possible values::

        0 - Turn off connection pooling
        nn - timeout set nn seconds

CONN_TIMEOUT
    This will set timeout for operations on connections (connection, ??closing??, we're not sure).
    Possible values::

        0 - Default timeout to the database (which could mean no timeout)
        nn - timeout set nn seconds

ISOLATION_LEVEL
    This will set database isolation level at connection level
    Possible values::

        READ_COMMITED
        READ_UNCOMMITTED
        SERIALIZABLE

LOCK_MODE_WAIT
    This will set database LOCK MODE WAIT at connection level
    Application can use this property to override the default server
    process for accessing a locked row or table.
    The default value is 0 (do not wait for the lock).
    Possible values::

        -1 - WAIT until the lock is released.
        0 - DO NOT WAIT, end the operation, and return with error.
        nn - WAIT for nn seconds for the lock to be released.

VALIDATE_CONNECTION
    Whether existing connections should be validated at the start of the request. Defaults to
    `False`.

VALIDATION_INTERVAL
    How often in seconds to revalidate connections if `VALIDATE_CONNECTION` is enabled. Defaults to
    `300` (5 minutes).

VALIDATION_QUERY
    Query used to validate whether a connection is usable. Defaults to
    `"SELECT 1 FROM sysmaster:sysdual"`.

CONNECTION_RETRY
    When opening a new connection to the database, automatically retry up to ``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` times
    in the case of errors. Only error codes in ``ERRORS`` will trigger a retry. The wait time
    between retries is calculated using an exponential backoff with jitter formula::

        random_between(WAIT_MIN, min(WAIT_MAX, WAIT_MULTIPLIER * WAIT_EXP_BASE ** (attempt - 1)))

    Defaults (wait times are in milliseconds)::

        MAX_ATTEMPTS: 1  # this implies no retries
        WAIT_MIN: 0
        WAIT_MAX: 1000
        WAIT_MULTIPLIER: 25
        WAIT_EXP_BASE: 2
        ERRORS: ['-908', '-930', '-27001']

    Each of these settings can be overridden in the ``CONNECTION_RETRY`` section of the database
    configuration in ``settings.py``. For example::

        DATABASES = {
           'default': {
               'ENGINE': 'django_informixdb',
               'CONNECTION_RETRY': {
                   'MAX_ATTEMPTS': 10,
                   'WAIT_MIN': 0,
                   'WAIT_MAX': 500,
               },
               # ...
            },
         }

    The error codes that are retried by default correspond to the following errors:

    * ``-908 Attempt to connect to database server (servername) failed``
    * ``-930 Cannot connect to database server servername``
    * ``-27001 Read error occurred during connection attempt``

    These errors are often seen when the database server is too busy, too many clients are
    attempting to connect at the same time or a network firewall has chopped the connection.


.. note:
    The ``DRIVER`` option is optional, default locations will be used per platform if it is not provided.

.. note:
    The ``TEST`` option sets test parametes.  Use ``NAME`` to override the name of the test database
    and set ``CREATE_DB`` to ``False`` to prevent Django from attempting to create a new test
    database.

Using with the Docker Informix Dev Database
-------------------------------------------

The docker image from IBM for the Informix developer database image behaves a little differently compared to other images. As such it needs a little extra handling, and doesn't seem to work with docker-compose

Firstly we need to download and getting it running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -itd --name iif_developer_edition --privileged -p 9088:9088 -p 9089:9089 -p 27017:27017 \
    -p 27018:27018 -p 27883:27883 -e LICENSE=accept ibmcom/informix-developer-database:latest

This will download the image if it doesn't exist, and then run it with the name ``iif_developer_edition``. The first time this run, the image will do a bunch of initial setup stuff. As we used the ``-d`` option, it will run in the background as a detached process. So don't be concerned that you do not see anything in the output.

You can stop and restart the container with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker stop iif_developer_edition
    $ docker start iif_developer_edition

It seems that the Informix ODBC driver does not currently support creating databases. So we will need to do
that manually, by attaching to the running container

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker attach iif_developer_edition


This will give you a shell on the running container, and you can therefore use dbaccess to create your database.
You can exit this shell using ``Ctrl-p`` ``Ctrl-q`` without shutting down the whole container.

This Django database adaptor for Informix requires transaction support to be enabled in our database.
This is not the default within the Informix Developer image.  So you need to enable it on a per database basis:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker attach iif_developer_edition
    $ ontape -s -B <DB_NAME>

Again, you can detach using ``Ctrl-p`` ``Ctrl-q``.

Finally you need to ensure that our local dev database is included in the ``sqlhosts`` file. e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    dev    onsoctcp    localhost    9088

You should now be able to point Django to our local test database using the syntax detailed above.


Using Django InformixDB with docker-compose
-------------------------------------------

It is possible to use the Informix developer docker image with docker-compose with a little effort.

Example docker-compose.yml

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: '3'

    services:
        db:
            image: ibmcom/informix-developer-database
            tty: true # Needed to ensure container doesn't self terminate
            environment:
                LICENSE: accept
            privileged: true
            ports:
                - "9088:9088"
                - "9089:9089"
                - "27017:27017"
                - "27018:27018"
                - "27883:27883"


The key entry in the compose file which is out of the ordinary is `tty: true`. This allocates a (virtual) TTY to the container. The Informix developer database container expects a `tty` and terminates without one when run inside docker-compose.

Once it is up and running with `docker-compose up` you can run a `bash` shell on the running container with:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it informix_db_1 bash


Where `informix_db_1` is the name of the running container. From this shell you can create your DB with `dbaccess` etc.

.. warning::

    This approach still requires the SDK to installed locally and the appropriate environmental variables to be set up. Along with entries in `sqlhosts` and `/etc/services`


Testing against an Informix Database
------------------------------------

Due to a bug in the Informix ODBC driver, it is not currently possible to run Django tests normally. Specifically, it is not possible for Django to create a test database. As such, you will need to do it manually. By default Django will attempt to create a database with a name equal to the default database name with a ``test_`` prefix. e.g. if you database name is ``my_database``, the test database name would be ``test_my_database``.  This can be overridden with the ``NAME`` option under ``TEST``.

To prevent Django from attempting to create a test database, set the ``CREATE_DB`` option
under ``TEST`` to ``False``: see 'Configure settings.py' above.

You can follow the steps above, in the section on using Informix locally with Docker to create a test database. Then when running the test you can tell Django to re-use an existing database, rather than trying to create a new one with the ``-k`` parameter:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py test -k


For django_informixdb Developers
--------------------------------

To run the django_informixdb test suite, you need to set the INFORMIXDIR environment variable, and the tests
expect an Informix database at host "informix". Change that host in `test/conftest.py` if you need to.
Then run the test suite with:

    tox

This will run the tests under Django 1 and 2.


Docker based testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you don't want to install the Informix libraries and multiple versions of Python locally, then you can test within
Docker containers.

Try using the helper script `test-in-docker.sh`, or inspect the script and adapt for your own purposes.

Requirements: Docker 19.03.2 or newer and Docker Compose 1.24.1 or newer.
