# About
emipy is a package for processing data of pollutant releases and pollutant transfers.

The data are provided by the [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/member-states-reporting-art-7-under-the-european-pollutant-release-and-transfer-register-e-prtr-regulation-23) and [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/de/web/gisco/overview).
