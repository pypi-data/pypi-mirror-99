The following README gives you a brief overview about deflex. Read the full
`documentation <https://deflex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for all
information.

Installation
------------

To run `deflex` you have to install the Python package and a solver:

* deflex is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/deflex/>`_ and can be
  installed using ``pip install deflex``.
* an LP-solver is needed such as CBC (default), GLPK, Gurobi*, Cplex*
* for some extra functions additional packages and are needed

\* Proprietary solver


Use example
-----------

1. Run ``pip install deflex[example]``
2. Create a local directory (e.g. /home/user/deflex_examples).
3. Download the example scripts to this directory. There are two example. The
   `model_example.py
   <https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a5xrj/providers/github/examples/model_example.py?action=download&direct&version>`_
   will explain the modelling process, the
   `basic_analyses_example.py
   <https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a5xrj/providers/github/examples/basic_analyses_example.py?action=download&direct&version>`_
   will show you how to analyse the results.
4. Read the comments of each example, execute it and modify it to your needs.
   Do not forget to set the ``my_path`` in the examples first.
5. In parallel you should read the ``usage guide`` of the documentation to get
   the full picture.

Improve deflex
--------------

We are warmly welcoming all who want to contribute to the deflex library. This
includes the following actions:

* Write bug reports or comments
* Improve the documentation (including typos, grammar)
* Add features improve the code (open an issue first)


Citing deflex
-------------

Go to the `Zenodo page of deflex <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3572594>`_ to find the DOI of your version. To cite all deflex versions use:

**Figure 1:** Use one of the include regions sets or create your own one. You
can also include other European countries.

**Figure 3:** The resulting system costs of deflex have been compared with the
day-ahead prices from the Entso-e downloaded from `Open Power System Data
<https://open-power-system-data.org/>`_. The plot shows three different periods
of the year.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reegis/deflex/master/docs/images/emissions.svg

**Figure 4:** It is also possible to get a time series of the average emissions. Furthermore,
it shows the emissions of the most expensive power plant which would be
replaced by an additional feed-in.

**Figure 5:** The following plot shows fraction of the time on which the utilisation of the
power lines between the regions is more than 90% of its maximum capacity:
