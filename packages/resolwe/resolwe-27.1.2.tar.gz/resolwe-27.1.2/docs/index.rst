Resolwe
=======

Resolwe is an open source dataflow package for `Django framework`_. It offers a
complete RESTful API to connect with external resources. A higher layer of
convenience APIs for JavaScript, Python and R are in development. A collection
of bioinformatics pipelines is available within the `Resolwe Bioinformatics`_
project. We envision a similar toolkit for machine learning.
