\defgroup ParameterClass Parameter classes

Parameter classes collect information (usually) from parameter files.

Parameter classes are usually closely linked to a class where the
parameters may change the state of an object of this class.

Main goal of parameter classes are
1. _encapsulation_ of parameter information for the usage in another class,
2. easy _modification_ of the state of an object,
3. allow _key prefixes_ to read local parameters from a parameter files,
4. allow _user-defined implementation_ to change the state of an object in a user-defined way.
