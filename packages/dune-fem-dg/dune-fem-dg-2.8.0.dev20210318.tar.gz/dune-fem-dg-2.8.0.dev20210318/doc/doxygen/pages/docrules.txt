\page DocRules Some Basic Remarks Concerning Documentation
<!---------------------------------------------->
In the following some remarks on how to add to the Doxygen documentation of
dune-fem. Details on doxygen can be found on the Doxygen homepage (see link at
bottom of each page). Warnings concerning faullty documentation are recorded in
dune-fem/doc/doxygen.out. So this file should be empty...

- Mathematical formulas can be inserted into the documentation quite easily
  using a latex style notation.
- References to other classes or groups are automatically inserted if the name
  of the class or group is used in the text.\n
  Specific references can be added using the \\ref command followed by the text
  which should be highlighted using quotes ("...").
- The documentation of classes, typedefs, members, etc. always preceed the
  actual statement in the code.
- For deprecated members the command \\deprecated should be included in the
  documentation. For deprecated files the \\deprecated command can be inserted
  into a file documentation. All thus marked blocks will be linked into a
  related page.
- A new implementation can be marked as such by adding \\newimplementation to
  the documentation. This helps others to get an overview over new additions.
  Again, a related page linking all new classes is generated.
- Global parameters (using the Dune::Parameter class) should be
  documented (e.g. in the documentation of the class using this
  parameter) through the command 
  \c femparameter
  This command takes three arguments: 
  first argument is the name of the parameter, e.g., \c fem.timeprovider.factor,
  the second argument is a brief description and the third argument
  is a default value (if present, otherwise use two arguments).
  Example:
  \code
    \femparameter{fem.timeprovider.factor,a global factor for reducing the
                  timestep,1.}
    \femparameter{fem.example, a parmeter without default}
  \endcode
  Note the comma for seperating parameters for the command. If the
  description needs a comma in the text use \c \\,.
.

The following are of course only guidlines - please add to them.
