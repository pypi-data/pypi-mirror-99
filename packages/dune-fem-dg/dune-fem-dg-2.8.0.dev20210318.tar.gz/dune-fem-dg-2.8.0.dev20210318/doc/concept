What is dune-fem-dg?
====================

dune-fem-dg is a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations. 

A particular strength of dune-fem-dg is the possibility to test different numerical schemes with different parameters, i.e.:

DiffusionFlux = BR, CDG, CDG2...
AdvectionFlux = LLF, HLLC...
GalerkinType = CG, DG
Solver = istl, fem...
polOrder = 0, 1, 2...
GridDim = 1,2,3...
Adaptation = no, yes (Estimator...)
DimRange = 1,2,3..
Assembly = matrix-free/matrix-based
Codegen = yes/no
Parallel = yes/no


Which further PDEs are relevant for applications?
=================================================
* Navier-Stokes + Combustion
* MHD
* Biharmonic
* Wave equations
* Elasticity
* PDEs on surfaces


How should dune-fem-dg be used?
===============================

1. Prediscribed (i.e. already implemented) problems (i.e. exange of data functions problem.hh...)

2. Combine diverse modules with each other (multi physics)

3. Hardware optimization

4. Exchange and addition of simple mathematical methods ( (DG-)method, time discretization, preconditioning... )


Possible Papers regarding dune-fem-dg
=====================================

1. Use already simple implemented modules:
a) instationaryInstation√§r: Advection-Diffusion, Euler, compressible Navier-Stokes, scalar Advection, hyperbolic conservation laws (1 example for each)
b) stationary: Poisson, Stokes, Navier-Stokes (1 example for each)

2. Coupling of different modules (i.e. simulation of Atherosclerosis, Fluid-Structure-Interaction...)

3. [Stefan] biological motivated case studies regarding "Atherosclerosis"
