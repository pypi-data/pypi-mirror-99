Description: DUNE-FEM-DG
        ===========
        
        DUNE-FEM-DG is the implementation of Discontinuous Galerkin schemes
        using the DUNE-FEM framework. Stabilized DG schemes for hyperbolic
        as well as a wide range of different primal formulations
        for elliptic/parabolic problems are implemented.
        The operators can be used efficiently both in a
        explicit/matrix free implementation or used to
        setup a system matrix for use with the linear solvers available in DUNE-FEM.

        The avatar of the project shows the solution of
        the compressible Euler equations in 3D using
        the parallel-adaptive DUNE-ALUGrid and the DG
        discretization implemented in DUNE-FEM-DG.
