Description: # Annual Radiation
        
        Annual radiation recipe for Pollination
        
        This recipe calculates the annual radiation for each time step provided by a wea file.
        The outputs are stored under `results/direct` and `results/total`. Nighttime hours are
        filtered before running the simulation. To match the results for each of the hours,
        see the list of hours in sun-up-hours.txt.
        
        ## Methods
        
        This recipe calculates the total amount of Radiation by calculating the direct sunlight
        radiation from sun disks and adding them to the contribution from indirect sky radiation.
        
        ```console
        Total radiation = direct sun radiation + indirect sky radiation
        ```
        
        The number of bounces for direct radiation is set to 0 and cannot be modified by the user.
        You can adjust the number of bounces for indirect sky radiation.
        
        ## Limitations
        
        This recipe is limited to calculating up to `9999` number of suns at a time. This means
        you might need to break down the annual studies with smaller time steps into smaller
        runs. This limitation is a result of how Radiance sets a limit on number of modifiers
        in a single run. [See here](https://discourse.radiance-online.org/t/increase-maximum-number-of-modifiers-in-rcontrib/4684).
        We can address this limitation by either building our own version of Radiance
        or breaking down the modifier list and looping over them and merging back the results.
