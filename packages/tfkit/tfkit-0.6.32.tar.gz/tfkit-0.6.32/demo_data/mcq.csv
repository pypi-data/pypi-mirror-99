"Looking good , feeling good Born to a model mom and a suit maker dad , fashion was actually in my blood . I always had a strong desire to dress in a certain way and to stand out from the crowd . I made my own toys when I was a young child and sewed my first skirt at just 10 years old . A friend 's mother took one look at my skirt and told me that I should be a patternmaker . In high school I started making my own clothes , mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it . During the last two years of school , I worked part - time for a small business that made hand - painted silk clothing and bags . The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place . Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting . From there I worked at a top clothing store while I got my business started . For my business I started out with the idea that everything I did would be hand - made and one - of - a - kind , specially made for one individual who hopefully had the same tastes as me . Every morning I jumped out of bed , went to my studio and worked on my projects . This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work . And at night I even dreamed of new designs ! Fashion design is _ art . What I mean is that it 's something close to you and something you can touch and feel , and actually interact with . My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on , such as sewing and pattern - making . Even if you end up specializing , it 's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high - quality clothes . Also , if you dream of having your own clothing line , the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes . You have to try and do this because that 's the way you 're going to develop something that 's all yours and unlike anyone else 's . I passionately believe that the right clothing can make people feel better and give them more confidence . [SEP] When the author was in high school , she [MASK] was fond of hand - painted clothing [MASK] began to make clothes on her own [MASK] wore the latest fashions",1

"I 'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars , Jurassic Park , Multiplicity , or many of the other movies that describe cloning . Most of what you see in these movies is false . What you do n't know is that cloning could be dangerous , to the clone and to our society as a whole . I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons . What about identity ? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities . What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else 's genetic identity ? True , Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities . Also , these is a large power struggle here . Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person 's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities . The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have . Cloning would also deal with killing embryos   . You might not have known , but Dolly , the sheep that was cloned in 1996 , was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived . The rest died or were thrown away . Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans . cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone , at this present time , would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone . In studies done on cows , 4 out of 12 birth mothers died . There is a very high failure rate , which is shown in the cloning of Dolly . Even if you had a few good embryos , failures have been noticeable in animal tests . So , should we work ahead in the world of cloning ? I say no . the risks are greater than the benefits . It 's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother . We would be killing human lives in the process . It would also be a violation   of the clone 's right to its own genetic identity and personality . [SEP] According to the article , what is the author 's opinion about identity ? [MASK] People 's identity is completely determined by their genes . [MASK] Government has the rights to confirm people 's identities . [MASK] Cloning itself gives parents great power over identity .
