Description: DUNE-library
        ============
        
        DUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox
        for solving partial differential equations with grid-based methods.
        
        The main intention is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of
        legacy and/or new libraries. Using C++ techniques DUNE allows to use very
        different implementation of the same concept (i.e. grid, solver, ...) under
        a common interface with a very low overhead.
        
        DUNE was designed with flexibility in mind. It supports easy discretization
        using methods, like Finite Elements, Finite Volume and also Finite
        Differences.
        
        Dune-localfunctions
        -------------------
        This module provides interfaces and implementations for local
        finite element ansatz spaces, i.e., shape functions, associated
        interpolation functionals, and relation to grid entities.
