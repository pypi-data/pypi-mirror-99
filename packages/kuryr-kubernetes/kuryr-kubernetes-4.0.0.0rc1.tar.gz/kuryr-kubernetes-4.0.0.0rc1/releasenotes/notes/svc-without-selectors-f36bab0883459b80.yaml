    Added support for Services without Selectors. Kuryr now handles Services
    that do not define the .spec.selector, allowing the user to manually
    manage the Endpoints object. When using ovn-octavia provider, Kuryr
    only creates the Load Balancer resources for this type of Service if
    the IPs on Endpoints are on the Pods or Nodes Subnet.
