deprecations:
  - |
    Setting the ``sg_mode`` option for octavia is being deprecated.
    Main reason is that when ``sg_mode`` is create a new load balancer
    security group is created. However, when ovn-octavia provider is
    used that security group is not enforced, and thus there is no
    need to have been created.
    To address the other operation handled on this config, the
    ``enforce_sg_rules`` config can be used instead.
