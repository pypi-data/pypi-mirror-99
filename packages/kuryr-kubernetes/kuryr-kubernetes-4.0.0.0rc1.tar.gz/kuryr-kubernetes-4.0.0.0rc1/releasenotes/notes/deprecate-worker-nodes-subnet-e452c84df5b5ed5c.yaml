features:
  - |
    Kuryr will now support nested mode with nodes VMs running in multiple
    subnets. In order to use that functionality a new option
    `[pod_vif_nested]worker_nodes_subnets` is introduced and will accept a list
    of subnet IDs.
deprecations:
  - |
    Option `[pod_vif_nested]worker_nodes_subnet` is deprecated in favor of
    `[pod_vif_nested]worker_nodes_subnets` that accepts a list instead of a
    single ID.
