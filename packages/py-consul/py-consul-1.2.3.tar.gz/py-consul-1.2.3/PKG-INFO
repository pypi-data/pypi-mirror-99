        ======================================================
        
        Fork intent
        -----------
        
        The origin project https://github.com/cablehead/python-consul is not maintained
        since 2018.  As we're not able to get in touch with the maintainer (cablehead)
        to merge and release our PRs, we've forked the project in order to continue the
        maintenance of the project.  We also renamed the project to be able to upload
        on pypi; see https://pypi.org/project/py-consul/
        
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import consul
        
            c = consul.Consul()
        
            # poll a key for updates
            index = None
            while True:
                index, data = c.kv.get('foo', index=index)
                print data['Value']
        
            # in another process
            c.kv.put('foo', 'bar')
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install py-consul
        
        **Note:** When using py-consul library in environment with proxy server, setting of ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy`` and ``no_proxy`` environment variables can be required for proper functionality.
