Synopsis
========

``lru_ng`` provides a Python type for fixed-size, ``dict`` like mapping object
``lru_ng.LRUDict`` that performs cache replacement in the least-recently used
(LRU) order.

This is a fork of the original module ``lru``
<https://github.com/amitdev/lru-dict>. The new iteration of the module is
intended for better thread-safety, more robust performance, and greater
compatibility with Python 3.
