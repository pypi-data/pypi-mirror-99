# Plugwise python module

This module is the backend for the [`plugwise` component](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/plugwise) which we maintain in Home Assistant Core.

Our main usage for this module is supporting [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) / [home-assistant](http://github.com/home-assistant/core/)

Works out of the box with every Home Assistant installation

### Home-Assistant custom_component (beta)

Intended for users helping us test new features (use at your own risk)

See the [`plugwise-beta`](https://github.com/plugwise/plugwise-beta) repository for more info. Requires additional configuration/handling to get your integration running.

## Development/patches

Like Home Assistant Core we use `pre-commit` to validate your commits and eventually PRs.

Please make sure you at least ran `scripts/setup.sh` before attempting to `git commit`. But we sincerely recommended to also use local testing, see `tests/README.md` for more information.

On behalf all of us, big thanks to Plugwise and community members @riemers and @tane from [HAshop](https://hashop.nl)for their support and obviously all our users and testers who dealt with our typos and challenges.

We are just a bunch of guys anxious to get our (and your) Plugwise products working with Home Assistant.
