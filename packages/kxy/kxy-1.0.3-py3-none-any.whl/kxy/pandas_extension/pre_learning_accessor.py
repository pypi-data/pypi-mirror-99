	"""
	Extension of the pandas.DataFrame class with various analytics for **post-learning** in supervised learning problems.

	This class defines the :code:`kxy_pre_learning` `pandas accessor <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html>`_.

	All its methods defined are accessible from any DataFrame instance as :code:`df.kxy_pre_learning.<method_name>`, so long as the :code:`kxy` python package is imported alongside :code:`pandas`. 
	"""

		"""
		Estimate the highest performance metrics achievable when predicting the :code:`target_column` using all other columns.

		When :code:`problem_type=None`, the nature of the supervised learning problem (i.e. regression or classification) is inferred from whether or not :code:`target_column` is categorical.


		Parameters
		----------
		target_column : str
			The name of the column containing true labels.
		problem_type : None | 'classification' | 'regression'
			The type of supervised learning problem. When None, it is inferred from the column type and the number of distinct values.



		Returns
		-------
		achievable_performance : pandas.Dataframe
			The result is a pandas.Dataframe with columns (where applicable):

			* :code:`'Achievable Accuracy'`: The highest classification accuracy that can be achieved by a model using provided inputs to predict the label.
			* :code:`'Achievable R^2'`: The highest :math:`R^2` that can be achieved by a model using provided inputs to predict the label.
			* :code:`'Achievable RMSE'`: The lowest Root Mean Square Error that can be achieved by a model using provided inputs to predict the label.		
			* :code:`'Achievable Log-Likelihood Per Sample'`: The highest true log-likelihood per sample that can be achieved by a model using provided inputs to predict the label.

			* :code:`'Running Achievable R^2'`: The highest :math:`R^2` that can be achieved by a classification model using all variables selected so far, including this one.
