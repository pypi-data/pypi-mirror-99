	Extension of the pandas.DataFrame class with various analytics for **post-learning** in supervised learning problems.

	This class defines the :code:`kxy_post_learning` `pandas accessor <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html>`_.

	All its methods defined are accessible from any DataFrame instance as :code:`df.kxy_post_learning.<method_name>`, so long as the :code:`kxy` python package is imported alongside :code:`pandas`.

		Parameters

			The name of the column containing true labels.
		new_variables : list
			The names of the columns to use as new explanatory variables.
		problem_type : None | 'classification' | 'regression'
			The type of supervised learning problem. When None, it is inferred from whether or not :code:`target_column` is categorical.



		Returns
