We define a custom :code:`kxy` `pandas accessor <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/development/extending.html>`_ below, 
namely the class :code:`Accessor`, that extends the pandas DataFrame class with all our analyses, thereby allowing data scientists to tap into 
the power of the :code:`kxy` toolkit within the comfort of their favorite data structure.

All methods defined in the :code:`Accessor` class are accessible from any DataFrame instance as :code:`df.kxy.<method_name>`, so long as the :code:`kxy` python 
package is imported alongside :code:`pandas`.
