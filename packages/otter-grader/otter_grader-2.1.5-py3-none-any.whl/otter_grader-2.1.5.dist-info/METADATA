Otter Grader is a light-weight, modular open-source autograder developed by the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley. It is designed to work with classes at any scale by abstracting away the autograding internals in a way that is compatible with any instructor's assignment distribution and collection pipeline. Otter supports local grading through parallel Docker containers, grading using the autograder platforms of 3rd party learning management systems (LMSs), the deployment of an Otter-managed grading virtual machine, and a client package that allows students to run public checks on their own machines. Otter is designed to grade Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks, and is compatible with a few different LMSs, including Canvas and Gradescope.
