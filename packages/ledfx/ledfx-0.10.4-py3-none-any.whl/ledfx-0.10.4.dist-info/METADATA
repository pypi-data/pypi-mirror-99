What is LedFx?
----------------

What LedFx offers is the ability to take audio input, and instantaneously processes the audio into realtime light show to multiple LED strips/matrix.
No need to spend hours on end to program one song to program your LEDs, as LedFx will do this all for you!

LedFx real-time LED strip music visualization effect controller using is a network based devices (ESP8266/ESP32/Raspberry Pi 4) with support for advanced real-time audio effects! LedFx can control multiple devices and works great with cheap ESP8266/ESP32 nodes allowing for cost effective synchronized effects across your entire house!

Demos
-------

We are actively adding and perfecting the effects, but here is a quick demo of LedFx running three different effects synced across three different ESP8266 devices:

#. **Build your networked LED Strip.**
      - For most, this is the difficult step. Don't worry! There's guides here and online, and plenty of people able to help on WLED and LedFx Discord.
      - Follow the WLED guide to connect the LED strip and ESP together: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki.
      - Flash WLED to the ESP device: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/Install-WLED-binary
      - Ensure all WLED devices are powered on, and connected to your Wi-Fi.
      - Test you can access the WLED web interface from your PC. If so, then you're good to go!

#. **Install LedFx.**
      - After you have WLED installed on your ESP device, download: `LedFx.exe`_ and install LedFx.
      - For Mac and Linux, see the `installation documentation`_ or `LedFx Guide`_.

#. **Direct computer audio output to LedFx.**
      - Follow guide, `How to: Enable Stereo Mix in Windows 10`_.
      - Alternatively use `Voicemeeter`_. `Voicemeeter tutorial`_.
      - More information for `Linux and macOS users here <https://ledfx.readthedocs.io/en/master/directing_audio.html>`_.
      - Play some music in the background.

#. **Start LedFx.**
      - Your WLED devices should appear in LedFx, automagically configured and ready to go! üéÜüî•
      - If not, on the left hand side, click on Device Management -> ``Find WLED devices`` button, or ``Add Device`` to add them manually.
      - If they're still not showing up, make sure they're powered on and properly connected to your WiFi.

#. **Start using effects!**
      - Click on the device, select an effect eg ``scroll(Reactive)``, and press ``Set effect`` button.
      - Your lights should now be reacting realtime to your music! Enjoy the show üåà
