- **Bugfixes:** Chewing through them, slow and steady!

  - IP address resolution fixed for mDNS names.

  - Some rare race conditions captured.
  - Devices can now be renamed - 2021, what a year!
  - Various libraries updated for new hotness and fix underlying issues.

Known Issues
------------

- **Audio Input Handling**

  - LedFx might explode if you don't have a valid audio input stream. Sorry and whoops.

- **sACN Display Rate**

  - Still fiddling with the sACN library - currently the "refresh rate" variable is a best effort FPS and is not accurate.

- **Editing active device breaks it**

  - Maybe don't do this. We're working on it!

- **Incomplete Change List**

  - We just didn't keep track! Whoops!

Coming up...
------------

- **QLC+ Support**

- **Spotify Support [Beta]**

- **Effects Rewrite:** Build and customise your own effects from a palette of effect sources and colour mappings.

- **ColorChord effect:** Clone of `cnlohr's ColorChord <https://github.com/cnlohr/colorchord>`_ notefinding algorithm.

- **Missing a feature you'd love to see?** `Let us know on Discord <https://discord.gg/xyyHEquZKQ>`_!

Other News
----------

.. _LedFx Website: https://ledfx.app
.. |LedFx Website| replace:: **LedFx Website**

- |LedFx Website|_: We now have a website! Not much going on here save for hosting the Windows installer downloads.

- **Easy Windows Installation.** Windows users can download an installer that automatically updates LedFx with the latest features for you. `Windows installer download <https://ledfx.app/download/>`_

- **Automatic crash reporting with Sentry:** If something breaks, we'll know about it! Any errors will be automatically transmitted to the developers
  so we can fix them - in the unlikely event any sensitive personal data is transmitted with a crash report the developers will remove it as soon as possible.
  The crash reporter we use is Sentry - you can see their `privacy policy <https://sentry.io/privacy/>`_ that developers are held to. The LedFx privacy policy
  is pretty simple - we will use the logs to fix LedFx. We don't use any user analytics, user tracking or any of that.
