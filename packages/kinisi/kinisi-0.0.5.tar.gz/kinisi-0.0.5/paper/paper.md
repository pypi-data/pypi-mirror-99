# Summary

Molecular dynamics simulation are a popular tool for the study of diffusion in materials. 
However, the computational cost of these simulations limit the ``real-world'' timescale and system size that can the investigated. 
`kinisi` provides a straightforward interface, and compatibility with a variety of common simulation software packages, including VASP [@kresse_ab_1993,kresse_ab_1994,kresse_efficiency_1996,kresse_efficient_1996] and those compatible with MDAnalysis [@michaud_mdanalysis_2011,gowers_python_2016], for the accurate and statistically rigorous calculation of the mean-squared displacement and the associated uncertainty of atoms in a material.
The use of a custom blockstrapping method allows the mean-squared displacement and uncertainty may be obtained, and the time- and temperature-dependent relationships can then be studied with custom `uravu.relationship.Relationship` [@mccluskey_uravu_2020] objects.

The availability of this software will offer users the ability to accurately quantify the uncertainties in atomic displacement and introduce this into downstream modelling in a quantitative manner. 

# Statement of Need

Currently `kinisi` is the only software (to the authors' knowledge), that accurately quantifies the diffusion of atoms in materials and includes substantial compatibility with simulation software. 
While `pymatgen` [@ong_python_2013] and others are capable of estimating displacement and uncertainty, the methods applied lack the statistical rigour available in `kinisi`. 
Tutorials, and API level documentation is available online (kinisi.rtfd.io).
