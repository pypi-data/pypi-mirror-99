The platforms module
====================

    >>> from pysyte.oss import platforms
    >>> assert 'different OS platforms' in platforms.__doc__

Clipboard
=========

    >>> expected = 'fred was here'

This one does not work for Travis
    >>> if platforms.name == 'darwin':
    ...     platforms.put_clipboard_data(expected)
    ...     actual = platforms.get_clipboard_data()
    ...     assert actual == expected
