Description: # Description
        
        AppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multi-threaded, sandboxed python
        execution environment for writing automation apps for various types of Home Automation Software including [Home
        Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) and MQTT. It has a pluggable architecture allowing it to be integrated with
        practically any event driven application.
        
        It also provides a configurable dashboard (HADashboard)
        suitable for wall mounted tablets.

        ## Development of the AppDaemon library
        
        We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) for linting of the code, so `pip install pre_commit` and run
        ```
        pre-commit install
        ```
        in the repository.
