Description: # Alitra
        
        WIP Library for ALIgnment and TRAnsformation between fixed coordinate frames. The transform
        is described by a translation and a homogeneous rotation.
        
        Developed for transforming between the fixed local coordinate-frame and the asset-fixed
        coordinate-frame.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Installation from pip
        
        ```
        pip install alitra
        ```
        
        ```python
        import alitra
        help(alitra)
        ```
        
        ### Installation from source
        
        ```
        pip install .
        ```
        
        You can test whether installation was successfull with pytest
        
        ```
        pip install pytest
        pytest .
        ```
        
        ### Local development
        
        ```
        pip install -e /path/to/package
        ```
        
        This will install package in _editable_ mode. Convenient for local development
        
        ## Components
        
        ### Frame transform
        
        Class for transforming coordinates between two coordinates frames. Use custom
        dataclasses for conveniency, and to ensure that no mistakes are made in the transform.
        
        ### Align frames
        
        Finds the rotations and translations between two coordinate systems by minimizing the
        matching error given a set of points described in both coordinate frames.
        Run `python examples/example_manual_alignment.py` for a demonstration of its use.
