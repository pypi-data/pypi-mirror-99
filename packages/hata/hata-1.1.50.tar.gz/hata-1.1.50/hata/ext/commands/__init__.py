# Add the setup extension function

def setup_ext_commands(client, prefix=None, lite=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Setups the commands extension of hata on the given client with the given parameters.
    
    Note that this function can be called on a client only once.
    
    The function adds the following attributes to the client:
    - `.command_processer` : ``CommandProcesser``
    - `.commands` : ``_EventHandlerManager``
    
    And the following event handlers are added as well:
    - `message_create` : ``CommandProcesser``
    - `reaction_add` : ``ReactionAddWaitfor`` (Except if other ``EventWaitforBase`` instance is already added.)
    - `reaction_delete` : ``ReactionDeleteWaitfor`` (Except if other ``EventWaitforBase`` instance is already added.)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    client : ``Client``
        The client on what the extension will be setuped.
    prefix : `str`, (`tuple`, `list`, `deque`) of `str`, or `callable` -> `str`
        The prefix of the client's command processer.
        
        Can be given as `str`, as `tuple`, `list` or `deque` of `str`, or as a `callable`, what accepts `1` argument,
        the respective ``Message`` instance and returns `str`.
    lite : `bool`, Optional
        Whether only the extensions utility feature should be setup. May be useful for example when the client uses
        only slash commands. Defaults to `False`.
    **kwargs : Keyword arguments
        Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the created ``CommandProcesser``.
    
    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    ignorecase : `bool`
        Whether the prefix should be case insensitive. Defaults to `True`.
    mention_prefix : `bool`
        Whether user mentioning the client as first word in a message's content should be interpreted as a prefix.
        Defaults to `true`
    default_category_name : `None` or `str`
        The command processer's default category's name. Defaults to `None`.
    category_name_rule : `None` or `function`
        Function to generate display names for categories.
        Should accept only 1 argument, what can be `str`  or `None` and should return a `str` instance as well.
    command_name_rule : `None` or `function`
        Function to generate display names for commands.
        Should accept only 1 argument, what is `str` instance and should return a `str` instance as well.
    precheck : `None` or `callable`, Optional
        Function, which decides whether a received message should be processed
        
        The default one filters out every message what's author is a bot account and the channels where the client
        cannot send messages.
        
        The following parameters are passed to it:
        +-----------+---------------+
        | Name      | Type          |
        +===========+===============+
        | client    | ``Client``    |
        +-----------+---------------+
        | message   | ``Message``   |
        +-----------+---------------+
        
        Should return the following values:
        +-------------------+-----------+
        | Name              | Type      |
        +===================+===========+
        | should_process    | `bool`    |
        +-------------------+-----------+
        
    Returns
    -------
    command_processer : ``CommandProcesser`` or `None`
        The created command processer. Returns `None` if `lite` is given as `True`.
    
    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        - If `client` was not given as ``Client`` instance.
        - If `prefix` was not given meanwhile `lite` is `False`.
    RuntimeError
        - If the given `client` already has `command_processer` or `commands` attribute.
        - If the given `client` has a ``CommandProcesser`` instance added as `message_create` event,
