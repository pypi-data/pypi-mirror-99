'''
This module provides extension for the built-in socket module.

The TCP/IP socket based on the current operating system have no indicators how many data was sent (no packet barriers).
Therefore this module extends the socket, using the struct module to format packet length to 4 bytes.

The exposed interfaces of class 'StructuredSocket' is exactly the same as the built-in 'socket.socket',
but grabbing the packet with tools you will find the data header added to the packet.
