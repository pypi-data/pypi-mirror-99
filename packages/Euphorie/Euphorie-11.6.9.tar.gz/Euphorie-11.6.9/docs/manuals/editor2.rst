---------------------------------------
Creating a new OiRA tool
---------------------------------------

   After clicking on 'Add New OiRA tool' you will be brought
   to the page below:

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_5_addsurvey.png

   When creating a new OiRA tool you can choose from the following three
   options:

    1. Start with a blank OiRA tool

    2. Base my OiRA tool on an existing OiRA tool of my organisation.

    3. Base my OiRA tool on an existing OiRA tool of another organisation.

   Ad 1) Starting with a blank OiRA tool is particularly useful when you already
   have a paper-based OiRA tool for your organisation and would like to transfer
   this to the digital system.

   Ad 2) This option is recommended when you are: (a) planning to revise the
   contents of your OiRA tool and/or (b) would like to add new modules. This
   option is also useful for organisations which manage multiple
   (sector-)OiRA tools, of which the base modules are applicable to other
   OiRA tools.

   .. note:: 

     When dealing with minor amendments, e.g. typos, it would be best to
     implement these in the existing OiRA tool and simply republish it.

   .. note::

     When the risks won't be amended, but, for instance, only the
     clarifications you can simply create a new version (a copy) of the
     existing OiRA tool.

   Ad 3) You can decide which existing OiRA tool is most suitable for your
   sector. You can copy and modify it, and thus avoid having to create one
   from scratch. You have to determine the amendments for your own sector.
   For example, the butcher could copy and modify the OiRA tool of the fish
   retailer.

   In addition to the OiRA tool of a specific sector, you can also use the
   so-called generic checklist as a starting point. It's slightly more
   general, but it does contain all the relevant aspects for an OiRA tool. The
   base-OiRA tool has been an inspiration for many sector-specific Digital
   OiRA tools and is considered to be a suitable starting point. 
   
   .. note:: 
   
     THE BASE-OiRA TOOL WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE

   The base-OiRA tool provides solutions at module level, which you can copy and
   modify if needed. It doesn't provide solutions at a risk level. In
   addition, most modules of the base-OiRA tool start with a 'filter question',
   which determines whether the situation concerned will be applicable to the
   end-user.

   .. note ::
   
     After you've copied an existing OiRA tool, any changes made to the
     'source-OiRA tool' will not automatically be reflected in your own OiRA tool.
     When, for example, the butcher has copied the OiRA tool of the fish retailer
     and the fish retailer implements changes in their OiRA tool afterwards, these
     changes will not appear in the OiRA tool of the butcher.

   If you would like to copy the OiRA tool of another sector as a starting
   point, you need to first select the country in the drop-down menu and
   subsequently the sector of your choice.

   When this sector provides more than one version, you can view these
   versions and select one.

   Give the OiRA tool a name (title). This name will be shown to the end-user in
   the overview. Tip: The overview is in alphabetical order, so make sure to
   choose a name based on your sector, for example 'New Risk Assessment
   2010'.

   Then click on 'Save Changes' at the bottom of the page.

   Your OiRA tool will then be created. Please note that this can take a while
   if you've chosen to use a copy of an existing OiRA tool.

   In case of a new (blank) OiRA tool you will see a screen as shown below:

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_6_newsurvey.png

====================
Editing an OiRA tool
====================

   On the main page (top navigation tree) you indicate those things, that are
   of priority for the OiRA tool as a whole. You can modify these later, by
   clicking on 'Edit':

     .. image:: images/editor/editor_7_survey_version_edit.png


     * **Name**: you can modify the name of the OiRA tool. The name you enter here
       will not be visible to the end-user and is mainly intended to
       facilitate you in managing the version. For the first version (new
       OiRA tool) the name 'Standard' will automatically be selected.

     * **Description**: short content description.

     * **Introduction**: Please provide some relevant and encouraging 
       information for end-users of the OiRA tool:
    
       - The importance of risk assessment
       - The fact that risk assessment is not necessarily something complicated 
         (the idea is to demystify risk assessment)
       - **The fact that the tool has especially been conceived to meet the needs 
         of the enterprises of the sector**. It is important to specify here 
         precisely which end-users are expected to use the tool 
         (who is the end-user of the tool).

       **Please adapt this text according to your sector needs**, but try to 
       keep it short.

       You can add a hyperlink to a page/file containing the questionnaire 
       for employees as an input for the assessment if social partners in 
       your sector have decided that this is important.

       **You can insert hyperlinks**

     * **The evaluation can be skipped**: If this option is selected, 
       users are not obliged to fill in the evaluation phase.

     * **Language**: choose the language of the OiRA tool in the drop-down menu.

     * **Classification Code**: we plan to show the sector codes for all of
       Europe here in the near future (according to the NACE-standard). For
       now you can write the name of your sector.

   
   .. note::

      If you edit an OiRA Tool, you are in fact editing one of its versions. If you 
      haven't added any versions yet, you are still editing the "standard" version, which was
      added for you automatically. If you want to change title or description of the version
      container, you currently have to call its edit form directly like this:
      http://admin.oiraproject.eu/sectors/gb/bakery-sector/new-risk-assessment-2010/edit

   .. warning::

      Once a tool has been published, you cannot rename it anymore. 

   In the larger fields you can add both normal and formatted text. You will
   be able to identify this option from the grey bar at the top of the page
   (the 'formatting bar'). The formatting bar will only be visible when
   you're in a field where formatting is possible.

   We would recommend you to type the text into the field without formatting.
   When you paste text into the field from another program, e.g. Word, the
   font used in Word will automatically be copied over. You will then not be
   able to change the font with the formatting bar. Word generates code to
   convert the text to html (which is used in the OiRA tools generator).You will not see this
   code when you paste the text from Word into the OiRA tools generator, but it does exist
   'underneath' the text. Hyperlinks also have a fixed format in Word (colour
   and underlining), which is unchangeable after pasting into the OiRA tools generator. It's
   best to implement hyperlinks after the text has been entered correctly
   into the OiRA tools generator (see the explanation further below for creating links).

   Therefore, please keep in mind that pasting text from Word can cause
   unexpected effects. In addition, pasting text from programs other than
   Word can cause similar unexpected effects. This applies to all fields in
   the OiRA tools generator where formatting is possible. This is why we advise you to type
   the text into the field without formatting, instead of pasting from Word.
   When you do decide to paste from Word, it's best to ensure that all the
   text is already formatted correctly (font, size and colour). In addition,
   all text you paste in should ideally have consistent font, size and colour
   properties.

   The formatting bar offers the following options:

     * Bold (fat): you select (by dragging the mouse) a portion of text and
       click on 'B' in the formatting bar above the field.

     * Selecting the same text again and re-clicking 'B' will undo the bold
       font (this applies to all formatting options).

     * Italic (italicized): you select (by dragging the mouse) a portion of
       text and click on the 'I' in the formatting bar above the field. NB:
       Italicized text is generally not very legible on a screen.

     * Bullet points: you select the required lines and click on the icon
       with the dots.

     * Numbered list: you select the required lines and click on the icon
       with '1-2'.

     * Hyperlink (to a website): first type the text on which you would like
       to apply the hyperlink, for example: 'Also see this website'.
       Subsequently you select the text (by dragging the mouse). You then
       click on the button with the chain icon in the formatting bar. A new
       screen will then open:

       .. image:: images/editor/editor_8_place_a_link.png
       
     * At 'URL' you enter the web address, this must
       start with: ``http://``. Subsequently, you enter a title and indicate
       whether the link should open in a new screen by selecting the box.
       Then click on 'Save'. The link will appear as underlined text. Modify
       the link:: double click on the link. Delete the link: delete the linked
       word and retype it.

       .. note:: 
       
         URLs are the way to link to documents from the sector, which you want
         to add to the OiRA tool. For example: concept plans, concept drafts, 
         etc. Simply place the documents onto a website and create a hyperlink 
         to the site in the OiRA tool.

     * If you would like to offer actual documents (e.g. Word or PDF
       files) on your OiRA tool, you first have to place the documents onto a
       website (e.g. the site of your sector's organisation) and then create
       a link to these files as described above.

   With 'Ctrl-z' you can undo formatting and textual changes you made in the
   OiRA tools generator field (multiple changes can be undone, as long as you haven't clicked
   'Save').

   In addition, you can click the right button of your mouse when you are in
   a field, which will provide you with an applicable menu. When you select a
   word you will also see options such as: cut, copy, paste, etc.

   Alternatively, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

     * Copy: Ctrl-c.

     * Paste: Ctrl-v.

     * Cut: Ctrl-x.

     * Select all: Ctrl-a.

     * Undo: Ctrl-z.

     * Search (within the field): Ctrl-f.

   Click the 'Save' button (at the bottom) when you're finished, this will
   take you back to the last screen. A yellow bar at the top will confirm
   that the item has been modified, which means that the information has been
   saved.

   The functions described above apply to all fields in the entire OiRA tools generator where
   formatting is possible.

======================================
Creating the structure of an OiRA tool
======================================

   When completing/modifying the content it's essential to first consider
   which structure you will give your OiRA tool. With structure we mean: which
   main modules and/or submodules with risks will there be?

   The OiRA tool can contain main modules and submodules. 'Sub-submodules' are
   not possible.

   Within a module you can either add submodules or risks, a combination of
   both isn't possible. You can however add risks to a submodule.

   When you base the OiRA tool on an existing OiRA tool, it will already have a
   structure. Main modules and/or submodules can be added to, or removed from
   this structure. You can also copy and move modules, both within the OiRA tool
   and to other OiRA tools under your management (see the overview on the left).

   Click on the module/risk which you want to copy or move, and open the menu
   'Actions' (top right). Choose the desired option, go to the area where you
   want to move it (click in the desired OiRA tool and folder) and choose
   'Paste' in the Action menu.

   How can you determine the structure?

   When using an existing OiRA tool as a starting point, you should study the
   structure and adjust it where required.

   For example, the structure of a base-OiRA tool consisting of modules and sub modules is as follows:

   1. The building
    
      a. Every building
      b. Specific buildings
      c. Storage room / warehouse

   2. Type of work 
     
      a. Office work
      b. Delivery and removal of material
      c. Physical work
      d. Working on site
      e. Working with customers / clients / guests

   3. Special circumstances 
   
      a. Noise
      b. Climate: heat, radiation, cold, outdoors
      c. Vibrations
      d. Hazardours substances as raw material.
      e. Hazardours substances as a result / during work.
      f. Heights / crawl spaces / closed spaces.

   4. Tools / machines / means of transport.

   5. In case of emergencies

   6. Working and resting times

   7. Tasks / functions of workers

   8. Unwanted behaviour of colleagues

   9. General information

   10. Accidents
   
   11. Organisation of preventive measures. Prevention duties.

   In the base-OiRA tool it's easy to add main modules to the OiRA tools generator (half way
   through or at the end) or to create more submodules under existing main
   modules.

   It's also easy to delete main modules through the Action menu (top right)
   or move them up or down by dragging them.

   It's worth noting that in practice most sectors mainly expand and/or
   further specify the sections: 'Type of Work' (module 2), 'Special
   circumstances' (module 3) and occasionally 'The Building' (module 1), when
   modifying the basic OiRA tool.

   Now you can complete the OiRA tool with modules, submodules, risks
   and measures (solutions).

   In short the structure could look like this:

   * Main page OiRA tool

     * Profiling
    
       - 'Optional' profile module (Do you have a store?)
       - 'Repeatable' profile module (Name each store you have)

     * Modules
          
       - 'Optional' module (filter question: Do you use dangerous substances?)
       - 'Mandatory' module (must be filled in)

       * Submodules 

         - Risks
         - Measures (solutions)

   .. note:: 
   
     Terms used in the above example will be further clarified in the
     following chapters. 

=======================
Using Profile questions
=======================

---------------------------
What are profile questions?
---------------------------

   It is possible to **skip** or **repeat** modules in case they do not apply 
   to the activity of the end user (**optional** profile question) or they 
   apply to multiple objects (**repeatable** profile question). 

   Such questions are asked **before** starting the risk identification and 
   evaluation. If the end-user does not tick the optional profile questions 
   or does not add multiple objects, the related modules and risks 
   are **not displayed**.

   When determining which main modules and potential submodules should be
   created, it's important to consider the option of using a so-called
   **profile**, a **profile question** is asked before one starts the OiRA tool. It
   is used to determine the main sections, activities, etc. of the company.

   For example, for the bakery owner:

     * Do you have a store?

     * Do you have a stall at the market?

     * Do you own a sales truck?

   When the end-user answers with 'Yes', the submodules/risks are
   activated. The answer 'No' does not activate the submodules/risks. 
   Imagine this to be the same as if you would include or exclude a certain 
   part of a checklist, because it applies or does not apply to your situation.
   
   Apart from this, the end-user will be required to complete a certain
   number of obligatory modules.

   If you use a **repeatable** profile question, it will be possible for 
   the end-user to indicate ownership of more than one **object** (e.g. 
   multiple stores, stalls, sales trucks). Instead of putting a question, you would
   ask the user to name each **object** ("Name your bakery locations") and the user 
   will name the objects with names relevant to him (e.g. city center bakery, bakery head 
   quarters, bakery city park). Through this, the modules associated with 
   this **repeatable** profile will get repeated in the tool - once for each **object**.
   Imagine this to be the same as if you would make paper copies of a certain part of 
   a checklist, because it needs to be filled for each location's characteristics.
   
   Using a profile is particularly useful in sectors, where it's probable
   that a substantial number of modules with risks aren't relevant to all
   companies. If you expect that most companies will complete practically all
   modules, creating a profile will be unnecessary unless you would like to
   have the possibility of completing part of the modules multiple times (as
   in the example with the multiple stores).
   
   When someone replies with 'No' to an optional profile question,
   all subsequent risks will be nullified (when you don't own a market
   stall, these risks won't be shown). If someone replies with 'Yes', 
   then all the applicable risks will be shown.

   This module can thus be further completed as a normal module.
   
------------------------
Adding profile questions
------------------------
   
   You can create profile questions as follows: click on the top level of the OiRA tool
   (top link in the navigation tree on the left-hand side) and in the grey
   bar underneath the title you will find the button 'Add Profile Question'.

   You will see the following page:

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_10_profile_question.png

   Here you can add:

     * Title: the title of this module, for instance 'Working Circumstances',
       'Acquisition' or 'Physical Strain', etc. The end-user will see this
       title at the top of the page for the duration of answering this
       module's risks. Don't put a full stop after the title. A number
       isn't needed either, the module will be numbered automatically.

     * Description: a short description of this module.

     * Type:
        
        - optional: when you would like this module to start with a 
          filter question.
        - repeatable: when you would like to offer this module
          multiple times (e.g. per object).
        
   The profile question acts as a module. You now have to add submodules and 
   risks to it. You can do that by clicking the "Add Risk" or the "Add Module" 
   button on the profile question object. 
   
   .. image:: images/editor/editor_10a_add_module_to_profile.png
  
   You can modify the modules at a later stage by using the 'Edit' button.
   With the Action menu (top right) you can cut, copy and delete modules and
   by dragging them (up or down) you can change their sequence.

          
=======================================
Using the 'optional' feature in modules
=======================================

   Instead of determining which modules apply to the end-user through asking
   profile questions, there's also the possibility of initially offering all
   modules. The first question of a module will then be, if this module is
   applicable to the end-user. We do this by asking a 'filter statement' 
   expressed in a positive way,
   for instance a statement such as: 'Dangerous substances are used'. As
   such, the end-user will initially deal with the module 'Dangerous
   substances', If the user answers with 'No' to this statement he will 
   skip the whole module and potential sub-modules.
   It isn't possible to skip risks by answering 'Yes' to a filter
   question, only by answering 'No'.

   If a filter question in a main module is answered with 'No', any potential
   submodules will also be skipped. It's also possible to start submodules
   with a filter question. A combination of a main module with a filter
   question and related submodules with further filter questions ('nested
   filter questions'), is possible.

   Filter questions are not allowed to refer to potential risk, they only
   determine whether something is applicable or not. 

   Only one filter question may be used in a (sub)module. This is always the
   first question of the module. When there is a necessity to ask a 'double
   filter question', it's best solved by amalgamating the two questions and
   adding an explanation of what happens when one answers with 'Yes' or 'No'.

   Example: 'Physically demanding activities occur AND the prevention
   programme for physical strain has not yet been fully implemented.'

   Answer with 'Yes' when physically demanding activities occur AND the
   prevention programme for physical strain has not yet been fully
   implemented. Otherwise answer with 'No'.

   It's useful to start determining which modules could or should start with
   a filter question during the preparation of the module structure.

====================================
Creating modules, risks and measures
====================================

   When the module structure is clear and the decision has been made whether
   a profile will be used or not, it's a good idea to first completely
   implement the module structure into the OiRA tools generator. Only after that should you
   add the risks to the modules. It's not useful to start adding
   risks to modules when the structure has not yet been determined.

-----------
Add Modules
-----------

   You can create modules as follows: click on the top level of the OiRA tool
   (top link in the navigation tree on the left-hand side) and in the grey
   bar underneath the title you will find the button 'Add Module'.

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_9_creating_modules.png

   For a module you will see the following page:

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_11_add_module.png

   Here you can add:

   **Title**: 
       The title of this module, for instance 'Storage room',
       'Working at height' or 'Physical Work', etc. The end-user will see this
       title at the top of the page for the duration of answering this
       module's risks. Don't put a full stop after the title. A number
       isn't needed either, the module will be numbered automatically. 
       Keep it short and simple. Use everyday language and make sure end-user 
       will immediately understand it.

   **Description**: 
     Provide a short general description of the content 
     of the module. You can create links to useful external pages providing 
     additional relevant information.

   **This module is optional**: 
       Choose if you want to force the end-user to go through this module and 
       the related risks or if the module can be skipped, as not every company 
       in the sector has the same activities.

   **Question**: 
       If you have decided to make the module optional, you have 
       to enter a question to ask the end-user if the activity is carried out 
       in the enterprise. The answer has to be YES or NO. If NO is answered, 
       the end-user will skip the module.

   **Image**: 
       You can add an image.

   **Overview of solution**:
       At this level (module), in most of the cases only generic/orientative 
       solutions can be provided. Here it is important to stress the importance 
       of avoiding the risk, substituting the dangerous by the non-(or less) 
       dangerous, combating risk at source. The solution can underline or focus 
       on different aspects: technical and/or organisational, ...
       This text will appear in the action plan step. This overview of solution 
       at module level is compatible/complementary with the measure(s) proposed 
       at risk level.
       
   Click on 'Save' at the bottom of the screen.

   To add more main modules, again click on the top link in the navigation
   tree and select the button 'New Module'.

   To add a submodule to the current module, click on the module to which you
   want to add a submodule and select 'Add Submodule'.

   You can modify the modules at a later stage by using the 'Edit' button.
   With the Action menu (top right) you can cut, copy and delete modules and
   by dragging them (up or down) you can change their sequence.

---------
Add Risks
---------

   A risk is always placed inside a module or submodule. You first select the required
   module on the left-hand side. Don't add risks in the top level of the
   OiRA tool, only in the modules or submodules underneath.

   Open the required module and click on 'Add Risk' in the grey bar
   underneath the title.

   You will then see the screen below:

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_12_add_risk.png

   **Statement**: 
       Write a short positive statement about a possible risk 
       For example: 'There are no obstacles or trailing cables on the floors'. 
       Put a full stop after the statement. 
       For more information on how to properly formulate risk statements, see below.

   **Problem description**: 
       This is the inverse of the statement = a negative statement
       This field is mandatory as the negative statement will appear in the risk 
       evaluation and action plan steps (if the end-user answers NO to the positive 
       statement). 
       For example: 'There are obstacles or trailing cables on the floors'.

   **Description**:       
       Describe the risk and provide the end-user with any relevant 
       information. You can create links to useful external pages providing 
       additional relevant information.
       For example, put a clarification/explanation of the exact meaning of 'timely inspection'
     
   **Legal and Policy References**:
       Provide relevant legal information related to the risk/topic/issue. 
       You can create links to useful external pages providing additional relevant information.

   **Identification Phase**: 
       If checked, this offers to the user the possibility to answer with 
       'Not Applicable' in addition to the usual Yes/No in the Identification phase.

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_12b_add_risk.png

       
   **Evaluation Phase**: 
       Specify the risk type and the evaluation method. 
       For more information on risk types and evaluation, see below.
       
   .. image:: images/editor/editor_12c_add_risk.png

   **Main Image and Secondary Images**:
       On the risk page you can add images. One Main image, which will appear on a 
       prominent position and up to three secondary images, which will appear below.
       You should use these images to help describe the risk situation and eventually
       also the correct situation as a contrast.
       
       You will have to upload these images yourself. Make sure that the 
       images are clear and legible, not too large
       in surface size (maximum 300 x 300 pixels on the screen) and file size
       (maximum 100 kB). Give the image a clear file name, without spaces (for
       example: Danger_logo.jpg). When the image is ready to upload, you select
       it from your computer by using the 'Browse' button. The location and file
       name will appear in the field.

       This function will only allow you to upload images with a 'gif' or 'jpeg'
       extension. Any other files will first have to be placed onto a website and
       can be linked to from the text.

       After uploading the image, click on 'Save' (at the bottom of the page).

       You can modify the risks at a later stage by using the 'Edit' button. With
       the Action menu (top right) you can cut, copy and delete modules and by
       dragging them (up or down) you can change the sequence. You should do this
       before the OiRA tool has been published.

Formulating risks (positive statements)
---------------------------------------

   The risks have the form of statements. Avoid words such as *not / no / never* in the statement (and
   also in profile questions). Given that the end-user can only answer with
   'Yes' or 'No', a statement containing the word 'not' and the answer 'No'
   can lead to confusion. Reformulate for instance as follows:

   ``There are no obstacles or trailing cables on the floors``   
   
   -> 
   
   ``Floors are free from obstacles or trailing cables``

   When reformulation is not a possibility, try to clarify with an
   explanation what will happen when the end-user answers with 'No', e.g.:
   'By answering 'No', there is a risk, when answering 'Yes', there is no
   risk'.

   For all statements, the answer 'No' always indicates that there's a risk
   and the answer 'Yes' indicates there isn't a risk. 

   Any answers other than 'Yes' and 'No' are not possible, except for
   temporarily skipping the risk ('parking' it by not answering it) 
   during the OiRA tool (when
   the end-user doesn't know the answer immediately). In addition it's
   possible to offer the option 'Not Applicable', if necessary (see below for
   the procedure). This is useful for risks of which you can't predict
   whether they will be relevant to the end-user. Using the optional (filter)
   modules should however, to a large extent, avoid the end-user being
   presented with irrelevant risks.



Specify evaluation method
-------------------------

Chose one of these types:
   
   - **risk**: refers to the existing risks at the workplace or linked to the work 
     carried out. To identify and evaluate such risks it is often necessary to 
     examine the workplace (to walk around the workplace and look at what could 
     cause harm; consult workers, …).
     
   - **policy**: refers to agreements, procedures, management decisions regarding 
     OSH issues. These issues can be answered behind a desk (no need to examine the 
     workplace). They are not evaluated by the end-users (in the evaluation step). 

   - **top 5 risk**: refers to a risk considered by the sector/authorities among the 
     top 5 in the sector. "Top 5 risks" are considered by default as "high priority", 
     so end-users are not asked to evaluate them.

Risk
----

   This handles risks other than the commonly known Top 5 risks which are typical for 
   the sector. It concerns the risks which can occur inside the
   working area or during a working procedure. At this stage of creating the tool it isn't clear
   how high the risk is. You can ask the end-user to specify how high the
   risk is in two ways:

   **Calculated**:
       If you choose the CALCULATED method, the system will automatically calculate the 
       priority depending on what you ticked in the probability, frequency and severity 
       fields (based on the Kinney method). Chose wether to provide a pre-calculated 
       risk (that will appear to the end-user in the evaluation step), or to leave the 
       "no default" options (this means that you don't want to orientate the end-user 
       in the evaluation step).
       Anyway, the end-user is always free to overrule your presets.

       .. image:: images/editor/editor_13_evaluation_risk.png

       The questions for probability - frequency - severity are:

       How high is the probability that this risk will occur?

       * Small

       * Medium

       * Large

       How often is one exposed to this risk?

       * Almost never

       * Regularly

       * Constantly

       What is the severity?

       * Weak severity

       * Significant severity

       * High (very high) severity

       The program then calculates the level of the risk and it's priority in
       relation to the answers.

       You can help the end-user by pre-selecting the probability / frequency /
       severity options, according to your sector. The end-user will then be
       shown these options and can adapt them, if required. If you're unsure, or
       if you want the end-user to evaluate this individually, add 'No default'.
       The end-user will then see 'blank' bullet points in the evaluation.

   **Estimated**
       Select 'Estimated' when a calculation isn't necessary or
       possible. 

       .. image:: images/editor/editor_14_risk_evaluation_estimated.png

       Select the default priority by choosing wether to provide a rough estimation 
       of the risk (high, medium or low that will appear to the end-user in the 
       evaluation step) or to leave the "no default" option (this means that you 
       don't give directions to the end-user in the evaluation step). Anyway, the 
       end-user is always free to overrule your estimation.

Policy risk
-----------

   This concerns a question about policies (e.g. employment policy) or procedures 
   (e.g. acquisition). The end-user isn't asked to
   specify a priority here. When 'Policy risk' is selected, this doesn't have to be added to the
   evaluation but will be referred to again in the Plan of Action.

Top 5 risk
----------

   A top 5 risk is determined by the sector and is a high risk by definition.
   Here too, the end-user won't be asked to prioritise and it will be
   incorporated into the Plan of Action with a high priority.




--------------------
Solutions / measures
--------------------

   One of the goals of this tool is to help users with information on how to solve
   problems they encounter during the process. This is done by providing typical 
   solutions to general problem areas (by module) or specific problems (by risk). 
   Therefore you can add such solution information in a module and attach it to a risk.
   
   It is most comfortable for the end-user if you provide a solution for each risk, because 
   then the user will be able to pick solutions with a click to prepopulate the 
   action plan form.
   
   In some cases it might however be not possible to provide that specific solution information.
   Then you should at least specify an 'Overview of solution' on the module. This text should contain
   an approach for the user how to tackle the risks described in that module in a general way. This 
   information will be displayed in the Action plan before each specific risk is handled.

   You can add the "Overview of solution" in the module edit form. 

   - When you don't work with solutions per risk, it is important that you give an "Overview of solution"    
   - If you do work with solutions per risk, it is optional

-----------------------------
Solutions/measures - per risk
-----------------------------

   In addition to an 'Overview of solution' per module level, it is recommended that you
   create solutions for all risks. You can do this as follows:

   A solution is related to a concrete risk. First select the
   risk in the correct module and then click on 'Add
   Measure' in the grey bar.

   You will see a new screen with blank fields:

     .. image:: images/editor/editor_15_add_measure.png

   **Description**: 
       Start with words which reflect the core message of the
       measure, for example: 'Information and Instruction', and then offer
       the rest of the solution. This text helps to get the end-user started
       and explains the possibilities. In this field you can format the text
       and include links to documents or websites. If you would like to
       include an image, you can do this at the risk itself.
       This description text will not be incorporated into the Plan of Action.

   **General approach** (to eliminate or reduce the risk): 
       Describe what is your general approach to eliminate or (if the risk 
       is not avoidable) reduce the risk. 
       This text will be incorporated into the Plan of Action. 
       For example: 'Ensure the correct means of Personal
       Protection are used, according to...'. If the end-user selects this
       measure it will be copied over to the Plan of Action.
       

   **Specific action(s) required to implement this approach**: 
       Describe the specific action(s) required to implement this approach 
       (to eliminate or to reduce the risk).
       For example: 'Purchase a new machine which produces less noise/dust'.

   **Level of expertise and/or requirements needed**: 
       Describe the level of expertise needed to implement the measure, 
       for instance “common sense (no OSH knowledge required)”, “no specific 
       OSH expertise, but minimum OSH knowledge or training and/or consultation of 
       OSH guidance required”, or “OSH expert”. You can also describe here any 
       other additional requirement (if any).
       For example: Budgeting, Rraining for Prevention/Safety staff, incorporating 
       this subject in team meetings, etc.

   If the end-user selects this measure it will be copied over to the Action plan. 
   End users can also rework the text.

   If the end-user selects this measure it will be copied over to the Plan of
   Action.

   Click on 'Save' at the bottom of the page.

   You can add more standard measures for each risk if needed, by clicking on
   the button 'Add Measure'.

-----------------------
Checking your OiRA tool
-----------------------

   When all the work has been done, i.e. the structure, contents and profile
   have been completed, you can view your OiRA tool (prior to making it public).

   This is done by clicking 'Preview' in the 'Versions drawer'. The online program with your
   (unpublished) OiRA tool will be shown in a new window.

   To view the preview you will have to register to the OiRA tool front-end, 
   the end-user will have to
   undertake the same action when starting the OiRA tool. After registering, you
   can complete the OiRA tool as an end-user.

   .. tip:: 
   
     check as many boxes as possible in the profile, answer the filter
     questions with 'Yes' and the risks with 'No'. This way you will view all
     risks and possibilities.

   When you discover faults in the preview you can amend these in the OiRA tools generator.
   Access the Preview again to check your modifications.

   .. note::
     
     The preview is stored in a separate place on the server, it won't be
     viewable to the end-users until you publish the OiRA tool.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Implementing your company logo and design into the OiRA tool(s)
---------------------------------------------------------------

   Straight after logging into the OiRA tools generator, you go to the 'Settings' menu (top
   right).

   You will see the following screen:

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_16_selecting_colours.png

   Here you can select the two most important colours: a main colour and a
   supporting colour. You can do this by clicking on the white circle (don't
   let go of it!) and dragging this to the colour of your choice. You will
   immediately see the effect on the logo at the top.

   You can also enter the colour code into the Hex-field underneath.

   .. note:: 

     It's recommended to let a designer determine the colours, who can ensure
     amongst other things that:

     * Appearance is clearly identifiable with the sector.

     * Legibility of the text (the OiRA tool end-user will often have to read
       large portions of text).

     * Forms of colour blindness (at 10% of the male population) are taken
       into account.
       
   The design changes are made to the sector, so they will apply to all OiRA tools created within 
   that sector.

Logo
----

   One sector logo can be placed at the top left of the program. If you want
   to include several logos, you will have to amalgamate these into one
   image.

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_17_logo_upload.png

   For best results, take a transparent 'PNG' file with a height of at least
   110 pixels. Larger logos will be resized automatically.

   Place the logo at your sector as follows:

   Under 'Logo' you check the box 'My logo', you then click on 'Browse' next
   to 'Choose file' to navigate to your own computer. To upload the image and
   link it to your own OiRA tool, click on --> 'Save' at the
   bottom of the page. You can change the image at a later date if need be,
   or opt for the standard logo.

---------------
Ready? Publish!
---------------

   Once you've successfully completed all steps it's time to publish your
   OiRA tool.

   When you click on 'Publish', the OiRA tool will be made available.
   
   .. image:: images/editor/editor_18b_publish_survey.png

   .. note::
     
     It can take some time to perform this action.

   A confirmation will appear in a green bar:

   .. image:: images/editor/editor_18_publish_survey.png

   From now on, the public can view and complete your OiRA tool. If it's a new
   OiRA tool we would like to be notified (oira@osha.europa.eu), and will put
   the link onto our site: www.oiraproject.eu. You don't have to notify
   us when you've updated the OiRA tool.

===============================
Modifying an existing OiRA tool
===============================

   The chapters prior to this are based on creating a new OiRA tool, potentially
   on the basis of an existing OiRA tool.

   Naturally the process of creating an OiRA tool will be followed by managing
   and maintaining your OiRA tool. In actuality, the exact same considerations,
   focus points and functionalities apply to this process.

   After adapting the OiRA tool you check it with the Preview and then publish
   it, as described above.


==================
OiRA tool versions
==================

  The risk assessment tool allows you to store several versions of your OiRA tool and manage these versions. You can manage OiRA tool versions using the Version drawer on the right side of the browser window. It is hidden by default and appears when you hover your mouse over the grey triangle.


  A OiRA tool should be revised periodically, usually to adapt it to the latest changes in legislation or other environmental changes. This is supported through versions of a OiRA tool, so that you can keep your old versions while you only publish the one that is most up to date. Updating an existing OiRA tool version usually means to only do minimal changes to adapt it to latest amendments in legislation or new findings. In this case you don’t want to create a new OiRA tool version but instead copy the old one and make amendments.

   * Mark a OiRA tool version
   * Click the Add version button.
   * Provide a Title
   * Make sure the correct base revision is selected
   * Click the Create button.

  Now you have a second OiRA tool version available and you can work on this one. Once you are done, you can publish it and it will replace the  existing OiRA tool.
