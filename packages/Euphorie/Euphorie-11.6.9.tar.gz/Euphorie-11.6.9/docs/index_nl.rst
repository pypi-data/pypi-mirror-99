Introduction
============

The euphorie risk assessment tool is based on hierarchical questionnaires. A
questionnaire (or survey) covers all possible risks for a specific sector of
industry.

Each sector organisation can have one or more surveys published simultaneously.
In order to facilitate development and testing of surveys the system supports
multiple versions for a survey. Only a single version of a survey can be public
at any point in time.
