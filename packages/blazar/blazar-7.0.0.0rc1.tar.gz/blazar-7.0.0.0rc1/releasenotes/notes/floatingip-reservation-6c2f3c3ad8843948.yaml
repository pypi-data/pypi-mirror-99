    Added a new resource plugin supporting floating IPs. This plugin enables
    users to reserve floating IPs from Neutron. To try the plugin, add
    ``virtual:floatingip`` to the ``[manager]/plugins`` configuration option in
    ``blazar.conf``. For the API schema, see details of the APIs in the `Lease
    API reference`_ and `Floating IP API reference`_.

    Note that this feature is available as a preview but is not yet complete.
    The Blazar CLI does not yet support it, documentation is incomplete, and
    the Update Lease API is not implemented. Floating IP reservation will be
    fully completed in the next release.
