upgrade:
  - |
    The previous instance reservation plugin, named 'basic.vm.plugin' in
    blazar.conf, is completely removed from Blazar. Deployments including
    this plugin in blazar.conf must be updated by removing it from the
    plugins list. Otherwise, the blazar-manager service will fail to start
    with an exception about invalid plugin names.
