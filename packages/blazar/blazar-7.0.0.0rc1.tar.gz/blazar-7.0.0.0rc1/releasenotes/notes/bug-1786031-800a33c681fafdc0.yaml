    When the update lease API returns any error regardless of the reason, the
    lease status goes into ERROR. If the reason is wrong input, e.g. invalid
    format or not enough hosts available, updating the lease again with correct
    information will fix the ERROR status. For more details, see `bug 1786031
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/blazar/+bug/1786031>`_.
