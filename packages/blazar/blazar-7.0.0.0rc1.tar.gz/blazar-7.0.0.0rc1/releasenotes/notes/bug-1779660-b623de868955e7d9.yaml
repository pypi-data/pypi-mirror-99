    In the `Blazar configuration`_, we have the following options:

    * os_admin_user_domain_name
    * os_admin_project_domain_name

    They are used for Keystone authentication. However,
    ``os_admin_project_domain_name`` in the configuration file was not
    reflected in Blazar. This was because internally in the Blazar service
    ``os_admin_user_domain_name`` was used wrongly for both the project domain
    name and the user domain name.

    This didn't affect operators who set neither of the values explicitly in
    the configuration file, because the default values of the two options are
    both set to ``Default``. This release fixes the bug for operators who set
    either of the values explicitly.
