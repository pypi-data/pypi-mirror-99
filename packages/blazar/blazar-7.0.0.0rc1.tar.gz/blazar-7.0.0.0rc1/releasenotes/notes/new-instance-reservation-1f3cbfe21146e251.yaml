    The new instance reservation feature is available from the Pike release.
    This feature enables a user to reserve instance slots on hypervisors for
    future usage. A user creates a lease for an instance reservation prior to
    creating the instance(s), then a confirmed reservation ensures he/she
    can create their instances within the reservation period. For detailed
    usage instructions, please read the Blazar documentation. Known limitation:
    in the Pike release this feature does not yet support reservations with
    affinity=True. Use the host reservation feature instead.
