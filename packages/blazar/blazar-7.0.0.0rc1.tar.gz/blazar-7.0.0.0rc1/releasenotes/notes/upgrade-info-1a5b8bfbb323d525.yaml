upgrade:
  - |
    All entities in the 'climate' namespace, such as those used in policy.json
    and some configuration values, have moved to the 'blazar' namespace in the
    Ocata release. When upgrading Blazar, please replace all configuration
    values including the 'climate' string by their 'blazar' equivalent.
deprecations:
  - |
    Commands which have 'climate' in their name are deprecated in Ocata. They
    will be completely removed in the Pike release. Instead of commands
    starting with 'climate', the Blazar project supports commands starting with
    'blazar' from Ocata.
