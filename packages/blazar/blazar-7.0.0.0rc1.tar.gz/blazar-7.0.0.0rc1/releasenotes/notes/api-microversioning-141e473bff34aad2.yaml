    Blazar now supports API microversions. All API changes should be made while
    keeping backward compatibility. The API version is specified in the
    ``OpenStack-API-Version`` HTTP header. To view the mininum and maximum
    supported versions by API, access the ``/`` and ``/versions`` resources.
    The Blazar API will include supported versions in the response data.
