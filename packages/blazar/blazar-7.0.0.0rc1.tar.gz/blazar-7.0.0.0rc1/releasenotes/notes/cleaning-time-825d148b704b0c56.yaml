    A time margin for cleaning up resources between the end of a lease and the
    start of the next lease is introduced. Leases are allocated to resources
    only if they have enough spare time for cleaning up before and after the
    lease. Note that this cleaning time is not included in the lease time, but
    is taken into account when looking for available resources. The length of
    cleaning time can be configured by the configuration option
    **cleaning_time** in the [DEFAULT] section. The default value for this
    option is **0**, in which case the behavior is the same as previous
    releases.
