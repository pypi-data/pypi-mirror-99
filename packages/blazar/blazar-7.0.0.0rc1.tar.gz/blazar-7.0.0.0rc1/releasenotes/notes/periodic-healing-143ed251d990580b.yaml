    Resource monitoring supports periodic healing from the Rocky release. It
    only heals reservations starting within a configurable time window in order
    to avoid unnecessary reservation healing, e.g. when resources become
    available again at a later date. The interval is defined with the
    ``[physical:host]/healing_interval`` configuration option. The default
    value is 60 minutes. For more details, please see the `Resource
    Monitoring`_ section in the Blazar documentation. The previous mode of
    operation, which heals all reservations regardless of their start date, can
    be used by setting ``[physical:host]/healing_interval`` to ``0``.
