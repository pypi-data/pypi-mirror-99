features:
  - Blazar gets to support before_end actions. Actions like snapshot can be
    taken at a specific time prior to the end of a lease.
    The time which triggers actions can be specified by the API parameter
    *before_end_date* and the default interval can be configured by a new
    configuration option *minutes_before_end_lease* in the [manager] section.
    The system default action for physical host plugin can be configured by a
    new configuration option *before_end* in the [physical:host] section.
    It can be also specified by a new API parameter *before_end* in a
    reservation. The value of this parameter can be *snapshot*, *default*, or
    blank. A system default action will be taken if *default* is specified or
    no *before_end* parameter included. If blank ("") is explicitly specified,
    no action will be taken.
upgrade:
  - The API parameter *before_end_notification* has been renamed
    *before_end_date* which is used for setting the time for triggering actions
    before the end of a lease.
  - The configuration option *notify_hours_before_lease_end* in the [manager]
    section has been removed. Use a new configuration option
    *minutes_before_end_lease* instead. The default value for the configuration
    option has been changed from 48 hours to 60 minutes.
