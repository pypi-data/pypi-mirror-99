    Lease status is introduced in this release.
    With this change, transition graphs of statuses of leases, reservations,
    and events are redefined while keeping backward compatibility.
    If you update Blazar from an older version, the lease status is
    automatically updated from *None* by an Alembic database migration script.
    See `state machine documentation`_ for more details.
