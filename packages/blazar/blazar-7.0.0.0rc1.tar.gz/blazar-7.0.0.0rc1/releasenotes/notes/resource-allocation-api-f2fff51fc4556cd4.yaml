    The List Allocations API and the Get Allocation API are newly implemented.
    The two APIs return list of mappings between a reservable resource and
    reservations. Currently Blazar only supports reservation of compute
    resources, so the APIs return mappings of hosts with reservation IDs of
    physical host reservations and instance reservations. See details of the
    API in the `API reference`_ .
