    Blazar handles availability zone information the compute host belongs to.
    When cloud operators add a compute host resource to the Blazar's freepool,
    Blazar records the availability zone into it's DB. The cloud user can
    specify the availability zone information by hypervisor_properties in the
    host reservation and by resource_properties in the instance reservation.

    The availability zone information is stored only when cloud operators add
    a new host to Blazar's freepool. If the operators needs the information,
    please re-add hosts already registered in Blazar.
