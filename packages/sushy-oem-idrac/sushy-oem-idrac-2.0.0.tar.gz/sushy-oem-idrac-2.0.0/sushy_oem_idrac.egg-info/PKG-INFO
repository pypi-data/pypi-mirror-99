Description: Dell EMC OEM extension for sushy
        ================================
        
        Sushy is a client [library](https://github.com/openstack/sushy) designed to
        communicate with [Redfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification))
        based BMC.
        
        Redfish specification offers extensibility mechanism to let hardware vendors
        introduce their own features with the common Redfish framework. At the same
        time, `sushy` supports extending its data model by loading extensions found
        within its "oem" namespace.
        
        The `sushy-oem-idrac` package is a sushy extension package that aims at
        adding high-level hardware management abstractions, that are specific to
        Dell EMC BMC (which is known under the name of iDRAC), to the tree of sushy
        Redfish resources.
        
        Example use
        -----------
        
        Once installed, sushy user can access Dell EMC OEM resources. For example,
        OEM extension of Manager resource can be instrumental for switching the
        node to boot from a virtual media device:
        
        ```python
        
        import sushy
        
        root = sushy.Sushy('http://mydellemcbmc.example.com')
        manager = root.get_manager('iDRAC.Embedded.1')
        
        oem_manager = manager.get_oem_extension('Dell')
        
        oem_manager.set_virtual_boot_device(
            sushy.VIRTUAL_MEDIA_CD, persistent=False, manager=manager)    
        ```
        
        See full example of virtual media boot setup in the
        [functional test suite](https://github.com/etingof/sushy-oem-idrac/blob/master/sushy_oem_idrac/tests/functional/vmedia_boot.py).
