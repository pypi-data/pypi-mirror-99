## :lock_with_ink_pen: Data Protection Impact Assessment
Deploying Federated Learning solutions in real life often requires careful analysis and approval of a variety of legal entities. As part of these processes, we at IKNL have written a [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), which you can find here](https://vantage6.ai/data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia/). Please note that this DPIA was executed by IKNL and is specific for our situation. It can be used as an example by other organizations, but it cannot be used verbatim.
