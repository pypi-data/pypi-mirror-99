        Odak (pronounced "O-dac") is the fundamental library for scientific computing in optical sciences. Odak includes modules for geometric [3D raytracing](odak/raytracing/), ~~2D paraxial raytracing~~, [Jones calculus](odak/jones), [beam propagation and wave optics](odak/wave) among with [a set of tools](odak/tools) to ease your pain in [measurement](odak/measurement), [exporting/importing CAD](odak/tools/asset.py), and [visualization](odak/visualize) during a design process. We have generated a set of recipes that goes well with machine learning approaches compatible with `torch` learning framework, which can also be found [here](odak/learn). We have created a bunch of [test scripts](test/), a complete [~~documentation~~](https://odak.readthedocs.io), [~~recordings~~](recordings) and ~~tutorials~~ for inspiring the way you use odak and helping your design process. For computationally expensive tasks, we have created a [distribution system](odak/manager) to process tasks in parallel across multiple computing resources within the same network. Odak can either run using CPUs or can switch to [NVIDIA GPUs](odak/__init__.py#L8) automatically.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Installing
        Odak can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip):
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install git+https://github.com/kunguz/odak
        ```
        
        or (not recommended at the time being):
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install odak
        ```
        
        Or you can also directly install using the source
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        It is easy as in this recorded session. Import it to your code and start designing your next in Optics!

        ### Examples
        We prepared a bunch of test routines, which can also play a role in guidance during using Odak, you find these test scripts in [here](test/). If you need more then the test scripts, reach out using issues. Remember there are no stupid questions, there are stupid answers. 
        
        ## Citing
        If you use Odak in a research project leading to a publication, please acknowledge this fact by using our ready-made [bibtex citation entry](citations/odak.bib).
        
        ## Contributing
        Perhaps the best way is checking the issues section as a starter. If you have a specific point in mind and can't find it in the issues section, starting an issue accordingly is an another good starting point.
