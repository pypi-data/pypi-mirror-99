Description: # PiWaterflow
        This is a resilient watering system, executed in a Raspberry Pi to control irrigation valves using relays.
        It's intended to be executed periodically (i.e. cron every 5 minutes).
        - Requirements:
          - Raspberry Pi (any model)
          - Relays to control the valves
          - Optional control relay to enable alternative power inverter
        - It supports 2 watering programs every day.
          - Programs can be forced at any time.
        - Valves can be manually triggered.
        - Programs, forced programs and manual Valves can be manually stopped.
        - Metrics can be emitted to influxdb to register actions (programs and valves).
        - This package fits with wwwaterflow, so that it can be controlled via HTTP page.
