    A Prometheus scope fetcher has been added in order to dynamically discover
    scopes from a Prometheus service using a user defined metric and a scope
    attribute.
    It can also filter out the response from Prometheus using metadata filters
    to have a more fine-grained control over scope discovery.
    It features HTTP basic auth capabilities and HTTPS configuration options
    similar to Prometheus collector.
