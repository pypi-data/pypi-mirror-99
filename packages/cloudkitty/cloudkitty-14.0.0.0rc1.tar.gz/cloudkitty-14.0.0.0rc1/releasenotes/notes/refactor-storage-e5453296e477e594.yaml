features:
  - |
    The storage system is being refactored.
    A hybrid storage backend has been added. This backend handles states
    via SQLAlchemy and pure storage via another storage backend. Once
    this new storage is considered stable, it will become the default storage.
    This will ease the creation of storage backends (no more state handling).

deprecations:
  - |
    All storage backends except sqlalchemy and the new hybrid storage 
    have been deprecated.
