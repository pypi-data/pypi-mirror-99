    CloudKitty's storage interface defaults to v2 from now on. v1 will be
    deprecated in a future release. Documentation about how to upgrade the
    storage backend along with some tools will be available at that point. New
    deployments should use the v2 storage interface.

    The default v2 backend is ``influxdb``. In order to keep using
    ``sqlalchemy``, specify "version = 1" and "backend = sqlalchemy" in the
    ``[storage]`` section of the configuration.
