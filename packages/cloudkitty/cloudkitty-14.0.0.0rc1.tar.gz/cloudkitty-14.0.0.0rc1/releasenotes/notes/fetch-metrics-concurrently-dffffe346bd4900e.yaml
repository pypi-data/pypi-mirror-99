    Metrics are now fetched concurrently with ``eventlet`` instead of one
    after another by the orchestrator, leading to a consequent performance
    improvement. The maximum number of greenthreads to use can be specified
    through the ``max_greenthreads`` option of the ``orchestrator`` section.
