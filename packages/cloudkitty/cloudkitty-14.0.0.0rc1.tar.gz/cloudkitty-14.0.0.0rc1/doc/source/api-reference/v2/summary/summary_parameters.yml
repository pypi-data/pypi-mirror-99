custom_fields:
  in: query
  description: |
    Optional attributes to customize the summary GET API response. When
    using this parameter, users can create custom reports. The default
    behavior is to list the sum of the quantity and the sum of the price,
    which is projected as ``rate`` field. The default value for the
    ``custom_fields`` parameter is ``SUM(qty) AS qty, SUM(price) AS rate``.
    One can customize this field as they wish with InfluxDB queries. The
    following statements ``"select", "from", "drop", "delete", "create",
    "alter", "insert", "update"`` are not allowed though. For instance, if
    one wants to retrieve the quantity field as the last value of the
    quantity, and not the sum (this is quite interesting when generating
    reports for storage values), the user can send the parameter as ``last(qty)
    AS qty, SUM(price) AS rate``. To discover all possible fields that one
    can work with, the user can also use ``*`` as a parameter.

    ``Currently this feature only works for Influx storage backend.`` It
    (the feature) depends on the storage backend driver to support it. If
    the user tries to set this configuration while using other storage
    backends, it will be ignored.
