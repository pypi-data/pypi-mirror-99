        Custom utility functions.
        
        This package contains a collection of utility functions for empirical work in Python.
        It's in progress and the API may change often. In addition to custom utility methods,
        the package includes wrappers for `fixest <https://github.com/lrberge/fixest>`_ 
        and `did <https://github.com/bcallaway11/did>`_.
        
        Example: Given a dataframe ``df`` with columns ``x, y, group_a, group_b`` 
        run a regression of ``y`` on ``x`` with group fixed effects, and double cluster:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from nostocalean import est
            
            summary = est.reg("y ~ x | group_a + group_b", data=df, se="twoway")
            print(summary)
        
        Example: Given a dataframe ``df`` with columns ``y, first_treat, group, time``
        report event study (aggregated group-time) estimates:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from nostocalean import est
        
            summary = est.es(y="y", d="first_treat", g="group", t="time", data=df)
            print(summary)
        
        Nostocalean also includes several utility functions, including CES and HARA
        
        Example: To sample a utility function, run:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from nostocalean.utility_functions import get_utility_function
            get_utility_function()
