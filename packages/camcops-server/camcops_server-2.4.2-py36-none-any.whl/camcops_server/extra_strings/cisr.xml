        Clinical Interview Schedule (Revised)
        See "BASIC CIS-R 02-03-2010.pqs", labelled "Basic CIS-R amended 18/06/2009"
        See also cisr_interview.pdf; GK confirmed (via Glyn Lewis, author) that
            this is the correct version...
            ... but it is labelled "1361 A 2/93 LC V5", is partial, and is a
            version for interviewer user.
        The PROQSY3 version is fully documented and organized for patients to
            use. We'll use this one.
        (The phrasings are very slightly different.)

        Original is:
            Lewis G, Pelosi AJ, Aray R, Dunn G (1992).
            Measuring psychiatric disorder in the community: a standardized
            assessment for use by lay interviewers.
            Psychological Medicine 22: 465-486.

        Computerized version is:
            Lewis G (1994).
