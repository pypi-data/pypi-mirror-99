    <string name="title">Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)</string>
    <string name="stem">The following questions concern information about your potential involvement with drugs not including alcoholic beverages during the past 12 months. Carefully read each statement and decide if your answer is “Yes” or “No”. Then, circle the appropriate response beside the question.\n\nIn the statements “drug abuse” refers to (1) the use of prescribed or over the counter drugs in excess of the directions and (2) any non-medical use of drugs. The various classes of drugs may include: cannabis (e.g. marijuana, hash), solvents, tranquilizers (e.g. Valium), barbiturates, cocaine, stimulants (e.g. speed), hallucinogens (e.g. LSD) or narcotics (e.g. heroin). Remember that the questions do not include alcoholic beverages.\n\nPlease answer every question. If you have difficulty with a statement, then choose the response that is mostly right.</string>
