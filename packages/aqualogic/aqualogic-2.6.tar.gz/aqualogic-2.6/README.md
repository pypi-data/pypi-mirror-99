# aqualogic
A python library to interface with Hayward/Goldline AquaLogic/ProLogic pool controllers. Based on Goldline prototol decoding work done by draythomp (http://www.desert-home.com/p/swimming-pool.html). Used by the [Home Assistant AquaLogic component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/aqualogic/).

Since the Goldline protocol uses RS-485, a hardware interface is required. I'm using an [RS-485 to Ethernet adapter](https://www.usriot.com/products/rs485-to-ethernet-converter.html), though you could use some other type of adapter (e.g. RS-485 to RS-232); the library just requires reader and writer file objects.

Tested on an AquaLogic P4 with Main Software Revision 2.91. YMMV.
