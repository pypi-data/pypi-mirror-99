    """
    In this example (given a traffic scenario) we search for the fixed-time schedule that minimizes the average
    delay that road uses (arriving during an horizon of 2 hours) are expected to experience at the intersection.

    Use case:
    This enables real-time optimization of traffic light control allowing truly dynamic and smart traffic
    light control that automatically adapts to the traffic situation. For example, by periodically computing the
    optimal fixed-time schedule, and automatically converting it to a vehicle-actuated controller (e.g., using
    the green times as maximum green times and allowing green times to be terminated prematurely).

    NOTE:
    To run the example below you need credentials to invoke the swift mobility cloud api.
    To this end, you need to specify the following environment variables:
    - smc_api_key: the access key of your swift mobility cloud api account
    - smc_api_secret: the secret access key of your swift mobility cloud api account
    If you do not have such an account yet, please contact cloud_api@swiftmobility.eu.

    In this example, we load an intersection from disk (export of Swift Mobility Desktop). This functionality is tested
    with Swift Mobility Desktop 0.7.0.alpha.
