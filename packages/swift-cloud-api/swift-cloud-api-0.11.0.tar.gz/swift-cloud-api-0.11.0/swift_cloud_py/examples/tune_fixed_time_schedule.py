    """
    In this example we show how to tune a fixed-time schedule.

    Use case: Traffic situations change throughout the day. This function allows you to quickly adapt the green times
    of an existing fixed-time schedule to a new traffic situations. This can be used, for example, to adapt the
    maximum greenyellow times of a smart traffic light controller to the current traffic situation in real-time.

    NOTE:
    To run the example below you need credentials to invoke the swift mobility cloud api.
    To this end, you need to specify the following environment variables:
    - smc_api_key: the access key of your swift mobility cloud api account
    - smc_api_secret: the secret access key of your swift mobility cloud api account
    If you do not have such an account yet, please contact cloud_api@swiftmobility.eu.

    In this example, we load an intersection from disk (export of Swift Mobility Desktop). This functionality is tested
    with Swift Mobility Desktop 0.7.0.alpha.
