Data and File Format</h1>
<strong>PaleoMag</strong> uses five different kinds of files, all of which
are

stored as text files: <a href="#SAM_format">.SAM</a>,<a href="#LSQ_format"> .LSQ</a>,

.STEP, <a href="#Sample_format">sample data files</a>, and <a href="#Means_format">means</a> files. With version 3.1, <a href="#app">Univ.

of Wyoming "APP" format</a> (ascii Ogg format), 2G's binary (.DAT)
format, and a <a href="#JRA">raw AGICO Spinner data format (.JRA)</a> are
supported
as
well as the original CIT format; the .STEP file is now dropped. The first four
of
these
filetypes
must
be
together
in
a
single
folder;
only
the 
.SAM and sample data files must be present (<strong>PaleoMag</strong> will create
 the others). The .SAM file gives locality information and a list of the samples

in the locality. Editting this file can allow the user to combine data from several
 different localities. The .LSQ file has the least-squares fits made for this
locality. 
The .STEP file need not concern most users; it contains a summary of the demag

steps used in the locality and can be regenerated at any time using the <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_FileM.html#RemakeStep">Remake .Step</a> command. Each sample data
file  contains all the measurements and orientations of a single core. The means
file 
need not be in any locality folder and can contain mean directions from several

different localities. 
<p>
With the creation of version 2.0 of <strong>PaleoMag</strong> files opened with 
<strong>PaleoMag</strong> have
their creator ID changed to <strong>PaleoMag</strong>; thus once you have examined a 
locality
with <strong>PaleoMag</strong>, you can open any sample in the locality for examination 
merely
by double-clicking on the sample's data file.  The data fork of these files in
unaffected and continues to be readable with any text editor and most word
processors.  Two strings have been added to the resource fork to permit
<strong>PaleoMag</strong> to distinguish the five types of files; one indicated the file 
type,
and the other has the name of the <a href="#SAM_format">.SAM file</a>.  If you change the 
name of the
.SAM file you must either open the locality by openning the .SAM file; opening
any other file in the locality will produce a file not found error.  Because
these strings must be present for <strong>PaleoMag</strong> to open files with a 
"Pmag" creator
id, do not ever assign plain text files transfered from another computer the
"Pmag" creator id!</p><p>

</p><h2>
<a name="SAM_format">.SAM file format</a></h2>
The data format used by <strong>PaleoMag</strong> is an ascii text file with fixed formats 
that
has been in use in the paleomagnetics laboratory at Caltech.  A sample
illustrates the format of the .SAM file (note that the top two lines are column
numbers):<p>

The first line is a 2003 addition specifying the data format and is either CIT,
  2G, APP, or JRA. If absent, the data is assumed to be in CIT format. After
  that is a comment line; the fields of the third line are the
locality's latitude (first 5 characters) in °N, locality longitude (next
5
after a space) in °E, and the magnetic declination (next 5 after a space)
in
°E of N.  Two fields can follow the magnetic declination: the azimuth
and plunge of a fold axis (both are 5 characters after a space). The following
two
fields (<u>underlined</u>) can be added by <strong>PaleoMag</strong> and will
usually
be 
blank before
using the code.  These are the average strike and dip of the beds at the
locality (used for the tilt-corrected reference directions; see "<a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_EditM.html#EqualArea">Equal Area
Options...</a>" under the Edit menu, above), both a space and 5 characters.
All
following lines are the filenames of samples from this locality with the
stratigraphic level ( 8 characters and <u>underlined</u>, indicating that it
is added
by <strong>PaleoMag</strong> to the standard CIT format) and the <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_SSL_sec.html">site id</a> (optional), which is

In the first line the first four characters are the locality id, the next 9 the
sample id, and the remainder (to 255) is a sample comment.
</p><p> In the second line, the first character is ignored, the next 6 comprise the 
  stratigraphic level (usually in meters). The remaining fields are all the same 
  format: first character ignored (should be a blank space) and then 5 characters 
  used. These are the core strike, core dip, bedding strike, bedding dip, and 
  core volume or mass. <a href="#Conventions">Conventions</a> are discussed below. 
  CIT format can include fold axis and plunge, which at present is unused.
</p><p>
The following lines are in the order the demagnetizations were carried out.
The first 2 characters (3 for NRM only) is the demag type (AF for alternating
field, TT for thermal, CH for chemical, etc.), the next 4 (3 for NRM) is the
demag level (°C for thermal, mT for alternating field, etc.), the next
6
(first blank for all the following fields) for geographic ("<i>in situ"</i>)
declination of the sample's magnetic vector, next 6 for geographic inclination,
next 6 for stratigraphic declination, next 6 for stratigraphic inclination,
next 9 for normalized intensity (emu/cm^3; multiply by the
core volume/mass to get the actual measured core intensity), next 6 for
measurement error angle, next 6 for core plate declination, next 6 for core
plate inclination, and the final three fields of 8 each are the standard
deviations of the measurement in the core's x, y, and z coordinates in 10^5 emu.<strong> NB
in 2003, it appears the CIT format is actually using three final fields of 9
characters, not 8.</strong>
</p><p>
Presently only the sample id line, the second line, and the first ten fields
(to core inclination but excepting the error angle) of the demag lines are used
in <strong>PaleoMag</strong>.  Except for the stratigraphic level, info on the second line 
is
only displayed in the <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_WindowM.html#Info">info window</a> or used in the

The first 14 characters comprise the full sample id. It is followed by the fit
type (L for line, P for plane, C for circle), 2 blanks, and the user-entered 3
letter id code.  After a blank, there is the geographic declination and
inclination and the stratigraphic (tilt-corrected) declination and inclination.
After a blank comes the summary of the points used in the least-squares fit;
measurements used are identified by letter (same as in the <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_WindowM.html#DataList">Data List</a> window--A
through Z then a through z for the first 52 measurements) up to 7 characters,
then the number of points used and the maximum angular deviation (<dfn>MAD</dfn>) of the
least squares fit.  For plane fits made with v.2.2 and beyond, the rake within
the plane of the farthest point (<img src="Craig_Jones_webpage_of_PMag_file_formats_CIT_file_format_source_files/phi.gif">s) and the of antipode of the beginning
point (<img src="Craig_Jones_webpage_of_PMag_file_formats_CIT_file_format_source_files/phi.gif">e) are given in the next 28 characters; these values bound the
arc within the plane where the second (characteristic) direction can lie (both
geographic and stratigraphic).  Positive values are down and away from the strike of the plane (90° 
counterclockwise from the down-dip direction).  This information is used by the "<a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_StatM.html#FLandP">Combine lines
and planes</a>" option with the "use arc constraints" option for <a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_Stat_sec.html#FisherLandP">Fisher statistics</a>.

For example, in the figure above (an equal-area plot), the measured directions
did not yield a clean estimate of the characteristic direction, but that
characteristic direction does not lie between the NRM and final directions.
Thus it should lie between the final point and the antipode of the NRM (marked
as "allowable range" in the figure).

exception of the .STEP file).  Unlike the other files, it can be shared between
localities.  Each locality mean, saved using the "<a href="http://cires1.colorado.edu/people/jones.craig/PMag_Formats.html#SAM_format">Save Means...</a>" command, fills

<a name="Conventions">Direction and orientation conventions</a></h2>
<strong>Conventions:</strong> All magnetization declinations (and azimuths and
 strikes) are degrees east of <b>true north</b>, all inclinations are in degrees,
  positive down. Bedding strike and strike of a fold axis are all relative to <b>magnetic
   north</b>. [NOTE that this differs from older documentation, but this is how
   PaleoMag  has always worked]. Sample coordinates x, y, and z are a right-handed
   coordinate  system with the positive x-axis extending from the core center
   out through the 
"scritch" (the top line of the core) and the positive z-axis parallel
 to the core axis and down into the outcrop. For the CIT conventions, core strike
 and dip are actually the strike and dip of the plane orthogonal to the core
(the  core plate). For bedding, if we define the z axis as perpendicular to bedding
 and positive (stratigraphically) downward, the positive x axis as going updip,
 and insist on a right-handed coordinate system, then the strike direction is
the  azimuth of the positive y direction (to the right as you face up-dip) for
both  bedding and core coordinates and the dip is the plunge of the negative
x axis.  In this system beds striking N30°W, overturned and dipping 75°
to  the southwest would have a strike and dip of 330° and 105°.
A core  drilled upward parallel to a line plunging 55° toward S25°E
would  have a core plate strike and dip of 25° and 125°; the core
drilled  in the opposite direction would have a strike and dip of 205°
and 55°. 
<p>
Core declination is measured in degrees clockwise from the x axis when viewed
from the negative z direction (see figure below).; core inclination is positive
from the x-y plane toward the positive z-axis.</p><p>
<img src="Craig_Jones_webpage_of_PMag_file_formats_CIT_file_format_source_files/PaleoMag_002.gif">
</p><p> Error angles reflect the uncertainty of the magnetization vector as reflected 
  in the difference between the directions determined from the core in up to 8 
  different orientations in the magnetometer.

  The columns are: sample name (1-10), demag step (11-18), magnetization's x-coordinate
    (19-24), y-coordinate (25-30), z-coordinate (31-36) in the core's coordinates,
    power of ten to multiply the magnetizations by (e.g., 10<sup>-4</sup> here)
    (37-40), the core azimuth (in the up-plunge direction, 180° from
    the usual reading in the field) (41-44), and core plunge (hade) (45-48),
    bedding dip direction (49-52), bedding dip (53-56), fold
bearing (57-60), and fold plunge (61-64). </p>
<p>Because sometimes the bedding strike and dip are
      not in the .JRA file (as in the above example), we have implemented a pop-up
      window that asks the user for
  the bedding strike and dip (in right-hand coordinates). Do not enter the bedding
  dip direction, but the azimuthal strike. This window opens ONLY when a sample
  window is opened for a sample lacking the bedding information. <br>
