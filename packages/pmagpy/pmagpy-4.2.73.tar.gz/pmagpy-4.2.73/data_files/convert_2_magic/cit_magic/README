The Occidential data were generated by Scott Bogue at Occidental College, California. Added D and B tags.

As described by Scott Bogue these are:

For the ARM acquisition steps, it is a pain to get all the info in six characters!   And I tried but couldn't figure out how to handle the two kinds of ARM acquisition experiments with a single tag.  So I made up two new ones:  Dxxxxxx for ARM acquisition with one bias field  at many **D**emag  steps and Bxxxxxx for one AF level and many**B** ias fields.  

For the D tags:

D50025:  first two nums are the bias field in uT, last three are the AF level in Oe (or mT x 10),  So:  50 uT bias field with AF of 2.5 mT.

D50900:  50 uT bias field and 90 mT AF.

So these tags will work for AF up to 99.9 mT and bias field up to 99 uT. In my files, the AF goes from 2.5 to 90 mT, and the bias field is 50 uT.


For the B tags:

B35025:  first two nums are the AF level in mT. last three are the bias field  in uT.  So:  35 mT AF with bias field of 25 uT

B35500   35 mT AF with bias field of 500 uT.

So these are good for AF up to 990 mT and bias field up to 999 uT.   In my files, the AF is 35 mT and the bias fields go from 25 to 500 uT.
