Thellier & Thellier 1959	LP-PI-ALT-PTRM	Paleointensity experiment: Alteration check using a pTRM check	This is a check for reproducibility of pTRM acquisition at a specific temperature. During a Thellier-type paleointensity experiment, the specimen is reheated to a lower temperature and cooled in the laboratory field, thus reapplying a pTRM.		Lab Protocol	
	LP-PI-BT-IZZI	Paleointensity experiment: Reciprocity check using in-field step, followed by zero-field step	Heating to a specific temperature to remove NRM and then cooling in a known magnetic field to induce TRM. Followed by heating to the same or lower temperature step and then cooling in zero, ambient magnetic field.		Lab Protocol	
Scherbakov et al. 1993 : Riisager & Riisager 2001	LP-PI-BT-MD	Paleointensity experiment: Reciprocity check using an attempted removal of a previously placed pTRM	A check carried out during Thellier-type procedures to detect multidomain grains. Additional zero field heating steps are used to remove a previously placed pTRM. The ability to remove a prior pTRM step at the same temperature imparted is used as an indicator of reversal.		Lab Protocol	
Thellier 1938	LP-PI-TRM	Paleointensity experiment: Using a laboratory TRM	Any paleointensity experiment that uses a TRM produced in a lab controlled field. Includes all variants of the Thellier method, including the Shaw method. More details on alteration and reciprocity checks can be added using the special LP-PI-ALT and LP-PI-BT method codes.		Lab Protocol	
	LP-PI-TRM-IZ	Paleointensity experiment: Using a laboratory TRM with an in-field step followed by a zero-field step	Heating the specimen to the desired temperature step and then cooling in known ambient magnetic field. Then heating to the same or lower temperature and then cooling in zero magnetic field to induce pTRM.		Lab Protocol	
	LP-PI-TRM-ZI	Paleointensity experiment: Using a laboratory TRM with a zero-field step followed by an in-field step	Heating the specimen to the desired temperature step and then cooling in zero ambient magnetic field. Then heating to the same or lower temperature and then cooling in a known magnetic field to induce pTRM.		Lab Protocol

As & Zijderveld 1958 : Collinson 1983	LT-AF-Z	Alternating field: In zero field	A specimen is subject to a decaying and alternating magnetic field such that the magnetic moments with coercivities below the peak field are aligned in opposed directions, and thus cancel. Specimens are typically reoriented in three or more orthogonal axes.	A	Lab Treatment	http://earthref.org/MAGIC/books/Tauxe/2005/lecture.09.htm#LT-AFZ

Coe 1967	LT-PTRM-I	pTRM check: After zero field step, perform an in field cooling	After treatment at a particular temperature step, the specimen is then reheated to a lower temperature and cooled with the laboratory field on thus reapplying a pTRM.

Riisager & Riisager 2001 : Scherbakov et al. 1993	LT-PTRM-MD	pTRM tail check: After in laboratory field step, perform a zero field cooling at same temperature	A check carried out during Thellier procedures to detect multidomain grains. Additional zero field heating steps are used to remove a previously placed pTRM. The ability to remove a prior pTRM step at the same temperature imparted is used as an indicator of reversal.

McFadden & McElhinny 1990	ST-R-2	Reversals test 2: Compares Watson's V statistic for normal and reverse modes with monte carlo simulation	This reversal test compares the means of the normal and reversed data, and assesses the quality using Watson's V-statistic to test whether the two samples could have been drawn from distributions sharing a common mean direction, depend on the number of observations in each sample and whether the two distributions share a common precision. Results can be classified as 'A' if _c <= 5¡, 'B' if 5¡ <= _c <= 10¡, or ÔC' if 10¡ <= _c <= 20¡, and indeterminate if _c > 20¡.	R	Stability Tests
