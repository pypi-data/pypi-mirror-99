Description: Fireant is a tool which aims to simplify the process of accessing analytical data and building dashboards and reports.  It eliminates the need for handwritten queries or code to process data. The main feature, the dataset, is a schema that is used to configure metrics, the data being visualized, and dimensions, the spatiality over which metrics can be extended and grouped. Included in the Slicer is a Slicer Manager API which exposes methods to render tables and charts in a variety of different formats.
        
        Fireant is a great compliment to Jupter notebooks using matplotlib and pandas. It can be used in web projects with Highcharts and React-Table.  It can even just provide a layer of abstraction for accessing analytical data akin to ORM libraries in software projects.
