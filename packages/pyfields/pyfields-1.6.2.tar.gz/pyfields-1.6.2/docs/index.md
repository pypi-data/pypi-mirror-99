`pyfields` provides a simple and elegant way to define fields in python classes. With `pyfields` you explicitly define all aspects of a field (default value/factory, type, validators, converters, documentation...) in a single place, and can refer to it from other places. 

It is designed with **development freedom** as primary target: 

 - *code segregation*. Everything is in the field, not in `__init__`, not in `__setattr__`.

 - *absolutely no constraints*. Your class does not need to use type hints. You can use python 2 and 3.5. Your class is not modified behind your back: `__init__` and `__setattr__` are untouched. You do not need to decorate your class. You do not need your class to inherit from anything. This is particularly convenient for mix-in classes, and in general for users wishing to stay in control of their class design.
 
 - *no performance loss by default*. If you use `pyfields` to declare fields without adding validators nor converters, instance attributes will be replaced with a native python attribute on first access, preserving the same level of performance than what you are used to.

It provides **many optional features** that will make your object-oriented developments easier:

 - all field declarations support *type hints* and *docstring*,

 - optional fields can have *default values* but also *default values factories* (such as *"if no value is provided, copy this other field"*)
 
 - adding *validators* and *converters* to a field does not require you to write complex logic nor many lines of code. This makes field access obviously slower than the default native implementation but it is done field by field and not on the whole class at once, so fast native fields can coexist with slower validated ones (segregation principle).

 - initializing fields in your *constructor* is very easy and highly customizable

 - you can automate fields creation with `@autofields` or even automatically add hash/dict/eq/repr to your class based on the fields using `@autoclass`.

Finally, it offers an API that other libraries can leverage to [get the list of fields](./api_reference.md#api).

If your first reaction is "what about `attrs` / `dataclasses` / `pydantic` / `characteristic` / `traits` / `traitlets` / ...", well all of these inspired `pyfields` a great deal, but all of these have stronger constraints on the class - which I did not want. Please have a look [here](why.md) for a complete list of inspirators.

## Installing

```bash
> pip install pyfields
```

For advanced type checking capabilities, `pyfields` requires that `typeguard` or `pytypes` is installed. Note that type checking performance (speed) mostly depends on the choice of type checking library. Not installing any will be faster, but will not support all of the `typing` constructs. Let's install `typeguard` for now:

```bash
> pip install typeguard
```

## Usage

Below we show a few prototypical examples to illustrate how versatile `pyfields` is. See [usage](./usage.md) for a more detailed, step-by-step explanation of all features.

!!! warning  "compliance with python 2's old-style classes"
    All examples in this doc assume python 3 and therefore show new-style classes without explicit inheritance of `object`, for readability. If you use python 2 do not forget to explicitly use new-style classes otherwise some features will not be available (the ones where a setter on the field is required: validation, conversion, read-only).

### 1. Defining a field

A field is defined as a class member using the `field()` method. The idea (not new) is that you declare in a single place all aspects related to each field. For mandatory fields you do not need to provide any argument. For optional fields, you will typically provide a `default` value or a `default_factory` (we will see that [later](#b-default-value-factory)).

For example let's create a `Wall` class with one *mandatory* `height` and one *optional* `color` field:

```python
from pyfields import field

class Wall:
    height: int = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    color: str = field(default='white', doc="Color of the wall.")
```

!!! info "Compliance with python < 3.6"
    If you use python < `3.6` you know that PEP484 type hints can not be declared as shown above. However you can provide them as [type comments](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#type-comments), or using the `type_hint` argument (recommended if you wish to use [type validation](#d-type-validation)).

#### a - Field vs. Python attr

By default when you use `field()`, nothing more than a "lazy field" is created on your class. This field will only be activated when you access it on an instance. That means that you are free to implement `__init__` as you wish, or even to rely on the default `object` constructor to create instances:

```python
# instantiate using the default `object` constructor
w = Wall()
```

No exception here even if we did not provide any value for the mandatory field `height` ! Although this default behaviour can look surprising, you will find that this feature is quite handy to define mix-in classes *with* attributes but *without* constructor. See [mixture](https://smarie.github.io/python-mixture/) for discussion. Of course if you do not like this behaviour you can very easily [add a constructor](#2-adding-a-constructor).

Until it is accessed for the first time, a field is visible on an instance with `dir()` (because its definition is inherited from the class) but not with `vars()` (because it has not been initialized on the object):

```python
>>> dir(w)[-2:]
['color', 'height']
>>> vars(w)
{}
```

As soon as you access it, a field is replaced with a standard native python attribute, visible in `vars`:

```python
>>> w.color  # optional field: the default value is used on first 'read' access
'white'

>>> vars(w)
{'color': 'white'}
```

Of course mandatory fields must be initialized:

```python
>>> w.height  # trying to read an uninitialized mandatory field
pyfields.core.MandatoryFieldInitError: \
   Mandatory field 'height' has not been initialized yet on instance <...>.

>>> w.height = 12  # initializing mandatory field explicitly
>>> vars(w)
{'color': 'white', 'height': 12}
```

Your IDE (e.g. PyCharm) should recognize the name and type of the field, so you can already refer to it easily from other code using autocompletion:

![pycharm_autocomplete1.png](imgs/autocomplete1.png)

#### b - Default value factory

We have seen above how to define an optional field by providing a default value. The behaviour with default values is the same than python's default: the same value is used for all objects. Therefore if your default value is a mutable object (e.g. a list) you should not use this mechanism, otherwise the same value will be shared by all instances that use the default:

```python
class BadPocket:
    items = field(default=[])

>>> p = BadPocket()
>>> p.items.append('thing')
>>> p.items
['thing']

>>> g = BadPocket()
>>> g.items
['thing']   # <--- this is not right ! 
```

To cover this use case and many others, you can use a "default value factory". A default value factory is a callable with a single argument: the object instance. It will be called everytime a default value is needed for a field on an object. You can either provide your own in the constructor:

```python
class Pocket:
    items = field(default_factory=lambda obj: [])
```

or use the provided `@<field>.default_factory` decorator:

```python
class Pocket:
    items = field()

    @items.default_factory
    def default_items(self):
        return []
```

Finally, you can use the following built-in helper functions to cover most common cases:

 - `copy_value(<value>)` returns a factory that will create copies of the value
 - `copy_field(<field_or_name>)` returns a factory that will create copies of the given object field
 - `copy_attr(<attr_name>)` returns a factory that will create copies of the given object attribute (not necessary a field)

#### c - Read-only fields

You can define fields that can only be set once:

```python
class User:
    name = field(read_only=True)

u = User()
u.name = "john"
print("name: %s\n" % u.name)
u.name = "john2"
```

yields

```bash
name: john

pyfields.core.ReadOnlyFieldError: 
   Read-only field '<...>.User.name' has already been initialized on instance 
   <<...>.User object at 0x000001CA70FA25F8> and cannot be modified anymore.
```

Of course this makes more sense when an appropriate constructor is defined on the class as we'll see [below](#2-adding-a-constructor), but it also works independently.

Optional fields can also be "read-only" of course. But remember that in that case, **reading** the field on a brand new object will assign it to its default value - therefore is will not modifiable anymore:

```python
class User:
    name = field(read_only=True, default="dummy")

u = User()
print("name: %s\n" % u.name)
u.name = "john"
```

yields

```bash
name: dummy

pyfields.core.ReadOnlyFieldError: 
   Read-only field '<...>.User.name' has already been initialized on instance 
   <<...>.User object at 0x000001ED05E22CC0> and cannot be modified anymore.
```

In practice if you have your own constructor or if you generate one using the methods [below](#2-adding-a-constructor), it will work without problem. But when debugging your constructor with an IDE that automatically calls "repr" on your object you might have to remember it and take extra care.

#### d - Type validation

You can add type validation to a field by setting `check_type=True`.

```python
class Wall:
    height: int = field(check_type=True, doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    color: str = field(check_type=True, default='white', doc="Color of the wall.")
```

yields

```
>>> w = Wall()
>>> w.height = 1
>>> w.height = '1'
TypeError: Invalid value type provided for 'Wall.height'. \ 
  Value should be of type 'int'. Instead, received a 'str': '1'
```

By default the type used for validation is the one provided in the annotation. If you use python < `3.6` or wish to override the annotation, you can explicitly fill the `type_hint` argument in `field()`. It supports both a single type or an iterable of alternate types (e.g. `(int, str)`). Note that PEP484 type comments are not taken into account - indeed it is not possible for python code to access type comments without source code inspection.

!!! success "PEP484 `typing` support"
    Now type hints relying on the `typing` module (PEP484) are correctly checked using whatever 3d party type checking library is available (`typeguard` is first looked for, then `pytypes` as a fallback). If none of these providers are available, a fallback implementation is provided, basically flattening `Union`s and replacing `TypeVar`s before doing `is_instance`. It is not guaranteed to support all `typing` subtleties.

#### e - Nonable fields

**Definition**

A *nonable* field is a field that can be set to `None`. It can be mandatory, or optional. By default, `pyfields` tries to guess if a field is *nonable* :

 - if a type hint is provided and it is PEP484 `typing.Optional[...]`, then this explicitly means that the fields is *nonable*. (Note: the choice of this name `Optional` is terrible but it is like that, see [this discussion](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/275#issuecomment-244736968)
 
 - if the field is optional with a default value of `None`, then this implicitly means that the field is *nonable*. This is not the recommended way anymore but it has the advantage of being compact, so it is supported by `pyfields`.

 - in all other cases, `pyfields` can not really tell and sets the field to *nonable=UNKNOWN*. 

You can override this behaviour by explicitly stating `field(nonable=True)` or `field(nonable=False)`.

See also [this stack overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57390073/how-to-type-check-a-function-in-python3-that-has-an-optional-argument-initially/57390124#57390124).

**Effect**

When a field is known to be *nonable*, all of its type checks and validators are skipped when `None` is received.

When a field is forced explicitly to `nonable=False`, by default nothing happens, this is just declarative. However as soon as the field has type checking or validation activated, then a `NoneError` will be raised when `None` is received.

#### f - Value validation

You can add value (and type) validation to a field by providing `validators`. `pyfields` relies on `valid8` for validation, so the basic definition of a validation function is the same: it should be a `<callable>` with signature `f(value)`, returning `True` or `None` in case of success. 

A validator consists in a base validation function, with an optional error message and an optional failure type. To specify all these elements, the supported syntax is the same than in `valid8`:

 - For a single validator, either provide a `<callable>` or a tuple `(<callable>, <error_msg>)`, `(<callable>, <failure_type>)` or `(<callable>, <error_msg>, <failure_type>)`. See [here](https://smarie.github.io/python-valid8/validation_funcs/c_simple_syntax/#1-one-validation-function) for details.
 
 - For several validators, either provide a list or a dictionary. See [here](https://smarie.github.io/python-valid8/validation_funcs/c_simple_syntax/#2-several-validation-functions) for details.

An example is probably better to picture this:

```python
from mini_lambda import x
from valid8.validation_lib import is_in

colors = {'white', 'blue', 'red'}

class Wall:
    height: int = field(validators={'should be a positive number': x > 0,
                                    'should be a multiple of 100': x % 100 == 0}, 
                        doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    color: str = field(validators=is_in(colors), 
                       default='white', 
                       doc="Color of the wall.")
```

yields

```
>>> w = Wall()
>>> w.height = 100
>>> w.height = 1
valid8.entry_points.ValidationError[ValueError]: 
    Error validating [<...>.Wall.height=1]. 
    At least one validation function failed for value 1. 
    Successes: ['x > 0'] / Failures: {
      'x % 100 == 0': 'InvalidValue: should be a multiple of 100. Returned False.'
    }.
>>> w.color = 'magenta'
valid8.entry_points.ValidationError[ValueError]: 
    Error validating [<...>.Wall.color=magenta]. 
    NotInAllowedValues: x in {'blue', 'red', 'white'} does not hold 
    for x=magenta. Wrong value: 'magenta'.
```

For advanced validation scenarios you might with your validation callables to receive a bit of context. `pyfields` supports that the callables accept one, two or three arguments for this (where `valid8` supports only 1): `f(val)`, `f(obj, val)`, and `f(obj, field, val)`.

For example we can define walls where the width is a multiple of the length:

```python
from valid8 import ValidationFailure

class InvalidWidth(ValidationFailure):
    help_msg = 'should be a multiple of the height ({height})'

def validate_width(obj, width):
    if width % obj.height != 0:
        raise InvalidWidth(width, height=obj.height)

class Wall:
    height: int = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    width: str = field(validators=validate_width,
                       doc="Width of the wall in mm.")
```

Finally, in addition to the above syntax, `pyfields` support that you add validators to a field after creation, using the `@field.validator` decorator:

```python
class Wall:
    height: int = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    width: str = field(doc="Width of the wall in mm.")

    @width.validator
    def width_is_proportional_to_height(self, width_value):
        if width_value % self.height != 0:
            raise InvalidWidth(width_value, height=self.height)
```

As for all validators, the signature of the decorated function should be either `(value)`, `(obj/self, value)`, or `(obj/self, field, value)`.

Several such decorators can be applied on the same function, so as to mutualize implementation. In that case, you might wish to use the signature with 3 arguments so as to easily debug which field is being validated:

```python
class Wall:
    height: int = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    width: str = field(doc="Width of the wall in mm.")

    @height.validator
    @width.validator
    def width_is_proportional_to_height(self, width_value):
        if width_value % self.height != 0:
            raise InvalidWidth(width_value, height=self.height)
```

See `API reference` for details on [`@<field>.validator`](api_reference.md#ltfieldgtvalidator).

See `valid8` documentation for details about the [syntax](https://smarie.github.io/python-valid8/validation_funcs/c_simple_syntax/) and available [validation lib](https://smarie.github.io/python-valid8/validation_funcs/b_base_validation_lib/).


#### g - Converters

You can add converters to a field by providing `converters`. 

A `Converter` consists in a *conversion function*, with an optional *name*, and an optional *acceptance criterion*. 

 - The *conversion function* should be a callable with signature `f(value)`, `f(obj/self, value)`, or `f(obj/self, field, value)`, returning the converted value in case of success and raising an exception in case of converion failure. 
 
 - The optional *acceptance criterion* can be a type, or a callable. When a type is provided, `isinstance` is used as the callable. The definition for the callable is exactly the same than for validation callables, see previous section. In addition, one can use a wildcard `'*'` or `None` to denote "accept everything". In that case acceptance is basically reduced to the conversion function raising exceptions when it can not convert values.


To add converters on a field using `field(converters=...)`, the supported syntax is the following:

 - For a single converter, either provide a `Converter`, a `<conversion_callable>`, a tuple `(<accepted_type>, <conversion_callable>)`, or a tuple `(<acceptance_callable>, <conversion_callable>)`. 
 
 - For several converters, either provide a list of elements above, or a dictionary. In case of a dictionary, the key is `<accepted_type>`/`<acceptance_callable>`, and the value is `<conversion_callable>`.

For example

```python
from pyfields import field
class Foo:
    f = field(type_hint=int, converters=int)
    g = field(type_hint=int, converters={str: lambda s: len(s), 
                                         '*': int})
```

When a new value is set on a field, all of its converters are first scanned in order. Everytime a converter accepts a value, it is applied to convert it. The process stops at the first successful conversion, or after all converters have been tried. The obtained value (either the original one or the converted one) is then passed as usual to the validators (see previous section).

As for validators, you can easily define converters using a decorator `@<field>.converter`. As for all converters, the signature of the decorated function should be either `(value)`, `(obj/self, value)`, or `(obj/self, field, value)`.

Several such decorators can be applied on the same function, so as to mutualize implementation. In that case, you might wish to use the signature with 3 arguments so as to easily debug which field is being validated:

```python
class Foo:
    m = field(type_hint=int, check_type=True)
    m2 = field(type_hint=int, check_type=True)
    
    @m.converter(accepts=str)
    @m2.converter
    def from_anything(self, field, value):
        print("converting a value for %s" % field.qualname)
        return int(value)
```

You can check that everything works as expected:

```bash
>>> o = Foo()
>>> o.m2 = '12'
converting a value for Foo.m2
>>> o.m2 = 1.5
converting a value for Foo.m2
>>> o.m = 1.5  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Invalid value type provided for 'Foo.m'. Value should be of type <class 'int'>.
  Instead, received a 'float': 1.5
```

Finally since debugging conversion issues might not be straightforward, a special `trace_convert` function is provided to output details about the outcome of each converter's acceptance and conversion step. This function is also available as a method of the field objects (obtained from the class).

```python
m_field = Foo.__dict__['m']
converted_value, details = m_field.trace_convert(1.5)
print(details)
```


#### h - Native vs. Descriptor

`field()` by default creates a so-called **native field**. This special construct is designed to be as fast as a normal python attribute after the first access, so that performance is not impacted. This high level of performance has a drawback: validation and conversion are not possible on a native field. 

So when you add type or value validation, or conversion, to a field, `field()` will automatically create a **descriptor field** instead of a native field. This is an object relying on the [python descriptor protocol](https://docs.python.org/howto/descriptor.html). Such objects have slower access time than native python attributes but provide convenient hooks necessary to perform validation and conversion.

For experiments, you can force a field to be a descriptor by setting `native=False`:

```python
from pyfields import field

class Foo:
    a = field()               # a native field
    b = field(native=False)   # a descriptor field
```

We can easily see the difference (note: direct class access `Foo.a` is currently forbidden because of [this issue](https://github.com/smarie/python-pyfields/issues/12)):

```python
>>> Foo.__dict__['a']
<NativeField: <...>.Foo.a>

>>> Foo.__dict__['b']
<DescriptorField: <...>.Foo.a>
```

And measure the difference in access time:

```python
import timeit

f = Foo()

def set_a(): f.a = 12

def set_b(): f.b = 12

def set_c(): f.c = 12

ta = timeit.Timer(set_a).timeit()
tb = timeit.Timer(set_b).timeit()
tc = timeit.Timer(set_c).timeit()

print("Average time (ns) setting the field:")
print("%0.2f (normal python) ; %0.2f (native field) ;" 
      " %0.2f (descriptor field)" % (tc, ta, tb))
```

yields (results depend on your machine):

```
Average time (ns) setting the field:
0.09 (normal python) ; 0.09 (native field) ; 0.44 (descriptor field)
```

!!! info "Why are native fields so fast ?"
    Native fields are implemented as a ["non-data" python descriptor](https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/descriptor.html) that overrides itself on first access. So the first time the attribute is read, a small python method call extra cost is paid but the attribute is immediately replaced with a normal attribute inside the object `__dict__`. That way, subsequent calls use native python attribute access without overhead. This trick was inspired by [werkzeug's @cached_property](https://tedboy.github.io/flask/generated/generated/werkzeug.cached_property.html).

!!! note "Adding validators or converters to native fields"
    If you run python `3.6` or greater and add validators or converters **after** field creation (typically using decorators), `field` will automatically replace the native field with a descriptor field. However with older python versions this is not always possible, so it is recommended that you explicitly state `native=False`.

### 2. Adding a constructor

`pyfields` provides you with several alternatives to add a constructor to a class equipped with fields. The reason why we do not follow the [Zen of python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python) here (*"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."*) is to recognize that different developers may have different coding style or philosophies, and to be as much as possible agnostic in front of these.

#### a - `make_init`

`make_init` is the **most compact** way to add a constructor to a class with fields. With it you create your `__init__` method in one line:

```python hl_lines="6"
from pyfields import field, make_init

class Wall:
    height: int = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    color: str = field(default='white', doc="Color of the wall.")
    __init__ = make_init()
```

By default, all fields will appear in the constructor, in the order of appearance in the class and its parents, following the `mro` (method resolution order, the order in which python looks for a method in the hierarchy of classes). Since it is not possible for mandatory fields to appear *after* optional fields in the signature, all mandatory fields will appear first, and then all optional fields will follow.

The easiest way to see the result is probably to look at the help on your class:

``` hl_lines="5"
>>> help(Wall)
Help on class Wall in module <...>:

class Wall(builtins.object)
 |  Wall(height, color='white')
 |  (...)
```

or you can inspect the method:

``` hl_lines="4"
>>> help(Wall.__init__)
Help on function __init__ in module <...>:

__init__(self, height, color='white')
    The `__init__` method generated for you when you use `make_init`
```

You can check that your constructor works as expected:

```python
>>> w = Wall(2)
>>> vars(w)
{'color': 'white', 'height': 2}

>>> w = Wall(color='blue', height=12)
>>> vars(w)
{'color': 'blue', 'height': 12}

>>> Wall(color='blue')
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'height'
```

If you do not wish the generated constructor to expose all fields, you can customize it by providing an **explicit** ordered list of fields. For example below only `height` will be in the constructor:

```python hl_lines="8"
from pyfields import field, make_init

class Wall:
    height: int = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")
    color: str = field(default='white', doc="Color of the wall.")

    # only `height` will be in the constructor
    __init__ = make_init(height)
```

The list can contain fields defined in another class, typically a parent class: 

```python hl_lines="9"
from pyfields import field, make_init

class Wall:
    height: int = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")

class ColoredWall(Wall):
    color: str = field(default='white', doc="Color of the wall.")
    __init__ = make_init(Wall.height)
```

Note: a pending [issue](https://github.com/smarie/python-pyfields/issues/12) prevents the above example to work, you have to use `Wall.__dict__['height']` instead of `Wall.height` to reference the field from the other class.

Finally, you can customize the created constructor by declaring a post-init method as the `post_init_fun` argument. This is roughly equivalent to `@init_fields` so we do not present it here, see [documentation](api_reference.md#make_init).


#### b - `@init_fields`

If you prefer to write an init function as usual, you can use the `@init_fields` decorator to augment this init function's signature with all or some fields.

```python  hl_lines="7"
from pyfields import field, init_fields

class Wall:
    height = field(doc="Height of the wall in mm.")  # type: int
    color = field(default='white', doc="Color of the wall.")  # type: str

    @init_fields
    def __init__(self, msg='hello'):
        """
        Constructor. After initialization, some print message is done

        :param msg: the message details to add
        """
        print("post init ! height=%s, color=%s, msg=%s" % (self.height, self.color, msg))
        self.non_field_attr = msg
```

Note: as you can see in this example, you can of course create other attributes in this init function (done in the last line here with `self.non_field_attr = msg`). Indeed, declaring fields in a class do not "pollute" the class, so you can do anything you like as usual.

You can check that the resulting constructor works as expected:

```
>>> help(Wall)
Help on class Wall in module <...>:
class Wall(builtins.object)
 |  Wall(height, msg='hello', color='white')
...

>>> w = Wall(1, 'hey')
post init ! height=1, color=white, msg=hey

>>> vars(w)
{'height': 1, 'color': 'white', 'non_field_attr': 'hey'}
```

Note on the order of arguments in the resulting `__init__` signature: as you can see, `msg` appears between `height` and `color` in the signature. This is because all mandatory arguments appear first, then the optionals - and within each group, the user-provided ones (e.g. `msg`) appear first. You can change this behaviour by setting `init_args_before=False`. See [API reference](api_reference.md) for details.


### 3. Simplifying

#### a - `@autofields`

Do you think that the above is still too verbose to define a class ? You can use `@autofields` to create fields and the constructor for you :

```python
from pyfields import autofields
from typing import List

@autofields
class Item:
    name: str

@autofields
class Pocket:
    size: int
    items: List[Item] = []

# test that the constructor works correctly
p = Pocket(size=2)
assert p.size == 2
p.items.append(Item(name="a_name"))
```

Note that members that are already fields are not further transformed. Therefore you can still use `field()` on some members, for example if you need to specify custom validators, converters, or default factory.

`@autofields` is just syntactic sugar for `field()` and `make_init()` - for example the `Pocket` class defined above is completely equivalent to: 

```python
from pyfields import field, copy_value, make_init

class Pocket:
    size = field(type_hint=int)
    items = field(type_hint=List[Item], 
                  default_factory=copy_value([]))
    __init__ = make_init()
```

By default type checking is not enabled on the generated fields, but you can enable it with `@autofields(check_types=True)`. You can also disable constructor creation with `@autofields(make_init=False)`. See [API reference](https://smarie.github.io/python-pyfields/api_reference/#api) for details.

#### b - `@autoclass`

Do you **also** wish to have `hash`, `dict`, `eq`, and `repr` views automatically created for your class ? From version `1.6` on, `pyfields` provides an `@autoclass` decorator. That way, your field definitions can directly be reused for most of the class behaviour.

```python
from pyfields import field, autoclass

@autoclass
class Foo:
    msg: str
    age: int = 12
    height: int = field(default=50)

foo = Foo(msg='hello')

print(foo)              # automatic string representation
print(foo.to_dict())    # automatic from/to dict
assert foo == Foo.from_dict(foo.to_dict())

assert foo == Foo(msg='hello', age=12, height=50)        # automatic equality comparison 
assert foo == {'msg': 'hello', 'age': 12, 'height': 50}  # automatic eq comparison with dicts
```

yields

```
Foo(msg='hello', age=12, height=50)
{'msg': 'hello', 'age': 12, 'height': 50}
```

!!!warning "use pyfields `@autoclass` over the one in `autoclass` library"
    This decorator combines `@autofields` and `@autoclass` into one, with options that are relevant to `pyfields`. Therefore it is now the recommended one to use.
    
See [API reference](./api_reference.md#autoclass) for details.

#### c - `VType`s

Instead of registering validators in the field, you can now use `vtypes`. That way, everything is in the type: type checking AND value validation. 

```python
from pyfields import field
from vtypes import VType

class NonEmpty(VType):
    """A 'non empty' validation type"""
    __validators__ = {'should be non empty': lambda x: len(x) > 0}

class NonEmptyStr(NonEmpty, str):
    """A 'non empty string' validation type"""
    pass

class Item:
    name: NonEmptyStr = field(doc="the field name")
```

Of course you can combine it with `@autofields` - do not forget `check_types=True` so that typechecking is enabled:

```python
from pyfields import autofields

@autofields(check_types=True)
class Item:
    name: NonEmptyStr
```

!!! note "`pytypes` does not currently support `vtype` so in order to benefit from this feature, you should either install `typeguard` or uninstall `pytypes` (to let the default `pyfields` type checker take over). See [this issue](https://github.com/Stewori/pytypes/issues/86)."

### 4. Misc.

#### API

`pyfields` offers an API so that other libraries can inspect the fields: `get_fields`, `yield_fields`, `has_fields`, `get_field`. See [API reference](https://smarie.github.io/python-pyfields/api_reference/#api) for details.

#### Slots

You can use `pyfields` if your class has `__slots__`. You will simply have to use an underscore in the slot name corresponding to a field: `_<field_name>`. For example:

```python
class WithSlots:
    __slots__ = ('_a',)
    a = field()
```

Since from [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots), *"class attributes cannot be used to set default values for instance variables defined by `__slots__`"*, **native fields are not supported with `__slots__`**. If you run python `3.6` or greater, `field` will automatically detect that a field is used on a class with `__slots__` and will replace the native field with a descriptor field. However with older python versions this is not always possible, so it is recommended that you explicitly state `native=False`.

Note that if your class is a dual class (meaning that it declares a slot named `__dict__`), then **native fields are supported** and you do not have anything special to do (not even declaring a slot for the field).
