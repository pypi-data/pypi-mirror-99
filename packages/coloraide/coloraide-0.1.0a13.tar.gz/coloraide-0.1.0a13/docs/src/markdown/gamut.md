# Gamut Mapping

## Overview

Many color spaces have limits the colors they can accurately represent. This is the color gamut. The bounds represent
the limits in which a color space can represent a color. Some color spaces are theoretically unbounded, but past a
point, the eye can't see them.

When moving from a large color space like CIELCH to a small color space like sRGB, many CIELAB colors will not fit
without mapping the color to one that does fit. This "fitting" of the color from one gamut into another is called gamut
mapping.

## Checking Gamut

A color can be checked to see if it fits in its own gamut or the gamut of another color space. Some color spaces may
have suggested limits for usability purposes, but may not have actual limits.

Let's assume we have a color `#!color rgb(30% 105% 0%)` which is not in its own gamut as the green channel exceeds the
sRGB limit of `100%`. We can check this via the `in_gamut` method, and we can see that it is not in gamut.

```color
Color("rgb(30% 105% 0%)").in_gamut()
```

We can also test if a color from one color space fits in a completely different color space. In the example below, we
can see that the LCH color of `#!color lch(100% 50 75)` is outside the narrow gamut of sRGB.

```color
Color("lch(100% 50 75)").in_gamut("srgb")
```

## Mapping Colors

The recommended approach for fitting/mapping a color is to compress the chroma while in the CIELCH color space (overly
simplified). This is the approach that our reference ([`colorjs`](https://colorjs.io/)) chose, so we ported it over here
as well.

In this example, we will take the color `#!color lch(100% 50 75)`. CIELCH's gamut is technically unbounded, but if we
try to fit it in the sRGB gamut, as noted earlier, it is outside the narrow gamut of sRGB. So, using the `fit` method,
and specifying `srgb` as the target color space, we can fit it in the sRGB gamut.

```color
Color("lch(100% 50 75)").fit("srgb")
```

If desired, simple clipping can be used instead of the default gamut fitting. Generally this is not recommended, but
there are times and places for everything. In this example, we can change the fitting `method` parameter to `clip`.
Notice the difference when compared to the previous fitting result:

```color
Color("lch(100% 50 75)").fit("srgb", method="clip")
Color("lch(100% 50 75)").fit("srgb")
```

Gamut fitting will always return a new color unless `in_place` is set `#!py3 True`.
