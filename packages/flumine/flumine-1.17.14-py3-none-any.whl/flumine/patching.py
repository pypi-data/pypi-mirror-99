"""
django style `lazy` object creation, the main bulk of processing
is turning {priceSize} into <PriceSize> objects but this is
pointless a lot of the time as the object is not used or can be
handled as a dict instead.

The inclusion of slots further reduces the processing time as well
as reducing memory.

This optimisation will improve normal streaming as well as
backtesting, with more speed, less CPU + ram and minimal reduction
in usability.
