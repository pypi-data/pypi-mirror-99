    Ansible-deploy driver has considerably changed in terms of playbook
    structure and accepted incoming variables.

    + all info passed into Ansible playbooks from ironic is now available in
      the playbooks as elements of ``ironic`` dictionary to better
      differentiate those from other vars possibly created/set
      inside playbooks.

    + any field of node's instance_info having a form of ``image_<field>``
      is now available in playbooks as ``ironic.image.<field>`` variable.

    + ``parted`` tag in playbooks is removed and instead differentiation
      between partition and whole-disk imaged is being done based on
      ``ironic.image.type`` variable value.

    + ``shutdown`` tag is removed, and soft power-off is moved to a separate
      playbook, defined by new optional ``driver_info`` field
      ``ansible_shutdown_playbook`` (the default ``shutdown.yaml``
      is provided in the code tree).

    + default ``deploy`` role is split into smaller roles,
      each targeting a separate stage of deployment process
      to faciliate customiation and re-use

      - ``discover`` - e.g. set root device and image target
      - ``prepare`` - if needed, prepare system, e.g. create partitions
      - ``deploy`` - download/convert/write user image and configdrive
      - ``configure`` - post-deployment steps, e.g. installing the bootloader

    **Any out-of-tree playbooks written for previous versions are incompatible
    with this release and must be changed at least to accept new variables!**
