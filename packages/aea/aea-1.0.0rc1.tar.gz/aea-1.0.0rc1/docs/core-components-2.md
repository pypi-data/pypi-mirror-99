The AEA framework consists of several core components, some required to run an AEA and others optional.

In <a href="../core-components-1">Core Components - Part 1</a> we described the common components each AEA uses. In this page, we will look at more advanced components. 

## Required components used by AEAs

### Decision Maker

The <a href="../api/decision_maker/base#decisionmaker-objects">`DecisionMaker`</a> can be thought of as a `Wallet` manager plus "economic brain" of the AEA. It is responsible for the AEA's crypto-economic security and goal management, and it contains the preference and ownership representation of the AEA. The decision maker is the only component with access to the `Wallet`'s private keys.

You can learn more about the decision maker <a href="../decision-maker">here</a>. In its simplest form, the decision maker acts like a `Wallet` with `Handler` to react to messages it receives from the skills.

### Wallet

The <a href="../api/crypto/wallet#wallet-objects">`Wallet`</a> contains the private-public key pairs used by the AEA. Skills do not have access to the wallet, only the decision maker does.

### Identity

The <a href="../api/identity/base#identity-objects">`Identity`</a> is an abstraction that represents the identity of an AEA in the Open Economic Framework, backed by public-key cryptography. It contains the AEA's addresses as well as its name.

The identity can be accessed in a `Skill` via the <a href="../api/context/base#agentcontext-objects">`AgentContext`</a>.

## Optional components used by AEAs

### Contracts

<a href="../api/contracts/base#contract-objects">`Contracts`</a> wrap smart contracts for third-party decentralized ledgers. In particular, they provide wrappers around the API or ABI of a smart contract. They expose an API to abstract implementation specifics of the ABI from the `Skills`.

`Contracts` usually contain the logic to create contract transactions and make contract calls.

`Contracts` can be added as packages. For more details on `Contracts` also read the `Contract` guide <a href="../contract">here</a>.

## Putting it together

Taken together, the core components from this section and the <a href="../core-components-1">first part</a> provide the following simplified illustration of an AEA:

### Relevant deep-dives

Understanding the decision maker is vital to developing a goal oriented and crypto-economically safe AEA. You can learn more about the `DecisionMaker` in the following section:

Understanding `Contracts` is important when developing AEAs that make commitments or use smart contracts for other purposes. You can learn more about the `Contracts` agents use in the following section:
