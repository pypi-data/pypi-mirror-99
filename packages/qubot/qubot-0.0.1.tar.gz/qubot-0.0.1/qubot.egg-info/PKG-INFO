Description: # Qubot
        
        An autonomous exploratory testing library for Python.
        
        
        
        It's a work in progress. See [experiments.ipynb](experiments.ipynb) for the experiment
        mentioned in "Qubot" paper.
        
        Hours of painstaking work have been put into this project thus far, but I hope this
        library finds actual use in the field of autonomous software testing.
        
        The Q-learning agent has been tested on [https://upmed-starmen.web.app/](https://upmed-starmen.web.app/),
        but feel free to use the sample code either in [experiments.ipynb](experiments.ipynb) or [qubot/scripts/test.py](./qubot/scripts/test.py)
        to test the agent out on your own software under test (SUT).
