    Horizon is now an optional dependency of networking-bgpvpn
    as the GUI support is optional. This means horizon will not be
    installed automatically. The horizon dependency is now declared
    in ``extras`` section in ``setup.cfg``. If you would like to enable
    the GUI support, you can install the dependencies using
    ``python -m pip install networking-bgpvpn[horizon]``
    (or ``.[horizon]`` in case you install it from the source code).
