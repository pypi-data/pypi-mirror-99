features:
  - BaGPipe driver improvement for a clean integration in the Neutron OpenVSwitch agent (see Bug `1492021 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1492021>`_).
    Instead of requiring to use a modified OVS agent, we now provide an extension that is loaded
    into the unmodified OVS agent.
fixes:
  - with BaGPipe driver, the OVS agent does not lose BGPVPN flows on restart (Bug `1531459 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1531459>`_)
