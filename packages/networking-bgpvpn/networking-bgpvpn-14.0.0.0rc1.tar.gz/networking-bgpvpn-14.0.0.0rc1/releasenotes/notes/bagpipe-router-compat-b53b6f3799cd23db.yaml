prelude: >
    The ovs/bagpipe driver now let you use both a Neutron
    router and a BGPVPN association simultaneously on a
    given Port.
features:
  - The bagpipe driver now let happily coexist a BGPVPN
    association and a Neutron router. Traffic that does
    not match any VPN route will be handled by the Neutron
    router. This evolution depends on corresponding evolutions
    in networking-bagpipe and bagpipe-bgp.
