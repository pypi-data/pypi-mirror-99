'''
    This module allows conveniently define magnet coils and perform magnetic analyses
    The module contains:
    * classes that parse ROXIE .data, .cadata, and .cond2data files.
    * classes that build magnet geometry (conductor and strand positions)
    * classes that perform magnetic analyses, such as magnetic field calculations and self-mutual inductance calculations
    * classes that generate input files for other programs, such as STEAM-LEDET or COMSOL
