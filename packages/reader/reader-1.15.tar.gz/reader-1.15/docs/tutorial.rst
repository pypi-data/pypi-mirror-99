    :noindex:


In this tutorial we'll use *reader* to download all the episodes of a podcast,
and then each new episode as they come up.

`Podcasts <podcast_>`_ are episodic series that share information as digital
audio files that a user can download to a personal device for easy listening.
Usually, the user is notified of new episodes by periodically downloading
an `RSS feed <rss_>`_ which contains links to the actual audio files;
in the context of a feed, these files are called *enclosures*.


.. _podcast: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast
.. _rss: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS


The final script is available as :gh:`an example <examples/podcast.py>`
in the *reader* repository, if you want to compare your script with the final
product as you follow the tutorial.


.. note::

    Before starting, install *reader* by following the instructions
    :doc:`here <install>`.


Adding and updating feeds
-------------------------

Create a ``podcast.py`` file::

    from reader import make_reader, FeedExistsError

    feed_url = "http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast?format=rss"

    reader = make_reader("db.sqlite")

    def add_and_update_feed():
        try:
            reader.add_feed(feed_url)
        except FeedExistsError:
            pass
        reader.update_feeds()

    add_and_update_feed()

    feed = reader.get_feed(feed_url)
    print(f"updated {feed.title} (last changed at {feed.updated})\n")


:func:`make_reader` creates a :class:`Reader` object;
this gives access to most *reader* functionality
and persists the state related to feeds to a file.

:meth:`~Reader.add_feed` adds a new feed to the list of feeds.
Since we will run the script repeatedly to download new episodes,
if the feed already exists, we can just move along.

:meth:`~Reader.update_feeds` retrieves and stores all the added feeds.

:meth:`~Reader.get_feed` returns a :class:`Feed` object that contains
information about the feed.
We could have called :meth:`~Reader.get_feed` before :meth:`~Reader.update_feeds`,
but the returned feed would have most of its attributes set to None,
which is not very useful.


Run the script with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 podcast.py

The output should be similar to this:

.. code-block:: text

    updated Hello Internet (last changed at 2020-02-28 09:34:02)

Comment out the ``add_and_update_feed()`` call for now.
If you re-run the script, the output should be the same,
since :meth:`~Reader.get_feed` returns data already persisted in the database.


Looking at entries
------------------

Let's look at the individual elements in the feed (called *entries*);
add this to the script::

    def download_everything():
        entries = reader.get_entries()
        entries = list(entries)[:3]

        for entry in entries:
            print(entry.feed.title, '-', entry.title)

    download_everything()

By default, :meth:`~Reader.get_entries` returns an iterable of
all the entries of all the feeds, most recent first.

In order to keep the output short, we only look at the first 3 entries for now.
Running the script should output something like this
(skipping that first "updated ..." line):

.. code-block:: text

    Hello Internet - H.I. #136: Dog Bingo
    Hello Internet - H.I. #135: Place Your Bets
    Hello Internet - # H.I. 134: Boxing Day


At the moment we only have a single feed; we can make sure we only get
the entries for this feed by using the `feed` argument; while we're at it,
let's also only get the entries that have enclosures::

    entries = reader.get_entries(feed=feed_url, has_enclosures=True)

Note that we could have also used ``feed=feed``;
wherever Reader needs a feed,
you can pass either the feed URL or a :class:`Feed` object.
This is similar for entries; they are identified by a (feed URL, entry id)
tuple, but you can also use an :class:`Entry` object instead.


Reading entries
---------------

As mentioned in the beginning, the script will keep track of what episodes
it already downloaded and only download the new ones.

We can achieve this by getting the unread entries,
and marking them as read after we process them::

    entries = reader.get_entries(feed=feed_url, has_enclosures=True, read=False)
    ...

    for entry in entries:
        ...
        reader.mark_as_read(entry)

If you run the script once, it should have the same output as before.
If you run it again, it will show the next 3 unread entries:

.. code-block:: text

    Hello Internet - Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Hello Internet Christmas Special
    Hello Internet - H.I. #132: Artisan Water
    Hello Internet - H.I. #131: Panda Park


Downloading enclosures
----------------------

Once we have the machinery to go through entries in place,
we can move on to downloading enclosures.

First we add some imports we'll use later,
and a variable for the path of the download directory::

    import os
    import os.path
    ...
    podcasts_dir = "podcasts"

In order to make testing easier, we initially write a dummy download_file()
function that only writes the enclosure URL to the file instead of downloading it::

    def download_file(src_url, dst_path):
        with open(dst_path, 'w') as file:
            file.write(src_url + '\n')

And then we use it in download_everything()::

    for entry in entries:
        print(entry.feed.title, '-', entry.title)

        for enclosure in entry.enclosures:
            filename = enclosure.href.rpartition('/')[2]
            print("  *", filename)
            download_file(enclosure.href, os.path.join(podcasts_dir, filename))

        reader.mark_as_read(entry)

For each :class:`Enclosure`, we extract the filename from the enclosure URL
so we can use it as the name of the local file.

:meth:`~Reader.mark_as_read` gets called *after* we download the file,
so if the download fails, the script won't skip it at the next re-run.

We also need to make sure the directory exists before calling
download_everything(), otherwise trying to open a file in it will fail::

    os.makedirs(podcasts_dir, exist_ok=True)
    download_everything()

Running the script now should create three .mp3 files in `podcasts/`:

.. code-block:: text

    Hello Internet - H.I. #130: Remember Harder
      * 130.mp3
    Hello Internet - H.I. #129: Sunday Spreadsheets
      * 129.mp3
    Hello Internet - H.I. #128: Complaint Tablet Podcast
      * 128.mp3

.. code-block:: bash

    $ for file in podcasts/*; do echo '#' $file; cat $file; done
    # podcasts/128.mp3
    http://traffic.libsyn.com/hellointernet/128.mp3
    # podcasts/129.mp3
    http://traffic.libsyn.com/hellointernet/129.mp3
    # podcasts/130.mp3
    http://traffic.libsyn.com/hellointernet/130.mp3


With everything wired up correctly,
we finally implement the download function using :mod:`requests`::

    import shutil
    import requests

    ...

    def download_file(src_url, dst_path):
        part_path = dst_path + '.part'
        with requests.get(src_url, stream=True) as response:
            response.raise_for_status()
            try:
                with open(part_path, 'wb') as file:
                    shutil.copyfileobj(response.raw, file)
                os.rename(part_path, dst_path)
            except BaseException:
                try:
                    os.remove(part_path)
                except Exception:
                    pass
                raise

``stream=True`` tells requests *not* to load the whole response body in memory
(some podcasts can be a few hundred MB in size);
instead, we copy the content from the underlying file-like object
to disk using :func:`shutil.copyfileobj`.

In order to avoid leaving around incomplete files in case of failure,
we first write the content to a temporary file which we try to delete
if anything goes wrong.
After we finish writing the content successfully,
we move the temporary file to its final destination.


Wrapping up
-----------

We're mostly done.

Uncomment the ``add_and_update_feed()`` call,
remove the ``entries = list(entries)[:3]`` line in download_everything(),
and clean up the files we created so we can start over for real:

.. code-block:: bash

    rm -r db.sqlite podcasts/

The script output should now look like:

.. code-block:: text

    updated Hello Internet (last changed at 2020-02-28 09:34:02)

    Hello Internet - H.I. #136: Dog Bingo
      * 136FinalFinal.mp3
    Hello Internet - H.I. #135: Place Your Bets
      * 135.mp3
    Hello Internet - # H.I. 134: Boxing Day
      * HI134.mp3
    ...

with actual MP3 files being downloaded to `podcasts/` (which takes a while).

If you interrupt the script at any point (:kbd:`CTRL+C`),
it should start from the first episode it did not download.
If you let it finish and run it again, it will only update the feed
(unless a new episode just came up; then it will download it).

    The web app and CLI are also (complicated) examples.
