# these are global environment variables that are required by each system to operate.
# this system section will contain information needed to connect to remote systems.
# in the event we roll our own system execution model.
# the backend will specify what type of execution model the system could have.
# for example, a multi-machine submission will not be supported using an in-memory backend.
