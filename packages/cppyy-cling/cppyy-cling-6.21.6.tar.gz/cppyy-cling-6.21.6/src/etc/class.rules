# This file contains a set of ROOT I/O customization rules.
# The short form of those rules is
#    [type=Read] classname membername [attributes=... ] [version=[...] ] [checksum=[...] ] [oldtype=...] [code={...}]
#
# See the documentation for TClass::AddRule for more details.
#
# Each rule must be on one line (possibly split with a trailing \)
