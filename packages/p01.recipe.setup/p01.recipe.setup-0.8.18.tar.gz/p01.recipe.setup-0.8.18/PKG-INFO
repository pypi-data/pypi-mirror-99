        ------------------

          doucmentation source and define a location (target) for generate the
          documentation. You can simply define a sphinx conf.py configuration with
          the conf argument.

        ------------------
        
        - feature: support environment variable in egg-scripts recipe

        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: fix resource path checking on windows where we have an exe script
        
        
        0.8.5 (2014-07-01)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: show error if script path is missing for scripts recipe
        
        
        0.8.4 (2014-03-25)

        - bugfix: fix attribute error if no initialization is given ein egg scripts
          recipe
        
        
        0.8.3 (2014-03-24)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: added egg-scripts recipe which is the same as the zc.recipe.egg
          script recipe but fixes path rendering on windows systems
        
        - feature: added popen recipe which uses any commaned string executed with
          subprocess Popen. This is used for setup graphite whichh breaks in any
          possible way using easy_install, setuptools or pip if used together with
          zc.buildout. Popen allows you simply to call python setup.py install with
          prefix and install-lib options. But don't forget to use the created part
          as an extra-paths in other parts.
        
        - feature: added pip recipe which supports installing packages like graphite
          which are broken in any possible way.
        
        
        0.8.2 (2013-12-10)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: added initialization to script and settings recipe
        
        
        0.8.1 (2013-11-23)
        ------------------
        
        - enhance template variable handling support $ as a prefix for ${}
        
        - improve path handling in template script
        
        
        0.8.0 (2013-10-09)
        ------------------
        
        - implemented celery recipe with PYTHONPATH support for fix broken forking
          on windows systems.
        
        - implemented settings recipe which is able to generate a settings.py file
          and use them as argument for run a script.
        
        - fix ``scripts``: bail out when any script exits with a non 0 exitcode
          also exiting with the same exitcode
        
        
        0.7.6 (2013-07-03)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: support module and method properties for use a custom
          paster.script.command run method. This let you define a custom paster script
          run comand which can call addition parts before loading all the
          paster ini modules. This is usefull for calling gevent.monkey.patch_all()
          or similar concepts before touch/loading any module which probably defines
          a global threading.local etc.
        
        - feature: support a initialization property which get applied after sys.path
          setup. This could also get used for define gevent.monkey.patch_all() or
          similar calls befor touch/loading any module in paster ini file.
        
        
        0.7.5 (2013-03-19)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: copy and simplify my 5 years old z3c.recipe.i18n locales extract
          scripts implementation to this package. The reason for this fork is that
          the z3c.recipe is based on some older zc.buildout and I do not like to break
          other developers setup. Note, this simpler implementation doesn't support
          relative paths.
        
        
        0.7.4 (2013-01-04)
        ------------------
        
        - bugfix: fix bad reference to self.options in fetch and copy recipe
        
        
        0.7.3 (2012-12-28)
        ------------------
        
        - remove root chown restriction, allow sudo -s -u <user> to use the chmod too.
          Let the system report errors if thre is no permission for chmod.
        
        
        0.7.2 (2012-12-26)
        ------------------
        
        - added owner and mode options to copy, copyscript, download, fetch, mkdir,
          mkfile and template recipes
        
        
        0.7.1 (2012-12-19)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: implemented fetch recipe which installs a script which is able to
          download a package relase (egg) and extract them to a defined location. This
          recipe can get used to install nginx or apache resources, certificates and
          other stuff released as an egg.
        
        - feature: implemented make recipe which installs a cmmi (configure, make, make
          install) script which can get used later. This is almost the same as the cmmi
          recipe but only installs a script which can get used later and is not
          proccessing cmmi during buildout.
        
        
        0.7.0 (2012-12-10)
        ------------------
        
        - feature: ported lovely.recipe importchecker since lovely.recipe raise errors
          e.g. Download error on svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/lovely.recipe
          unknown url type: svn -- Some packages may not be found!
        
        - fixed supervisor tests (remove offline=true)
        
        
        0.6.0 (2012-11-16)
        ------------------
        
        - fix parts - prefixing concept for paste recipe. This changes will generate
          different paste config file names e.g. paste.conf - zope.conf, paste.zcml
          will become site.zcml. This change allows to use name=foo in your recipe and
          this will generate prefixed paste config names e.g. foo-zope.conf and
          foo-site.zcml. This allows to use the same parts folder and share the same
          ZODB within different paste configuration (e.g. dev, minified sources etc.)
        
        - added script runner recipe and script. This script is useful for run other
          (more then one) scripts at once
        
        - added initial code for ctags generation (windows support). Added note about
          ctags issue wit large set of sys.path packages. Fix default languages option
          and added langmap option and include page template files as HTML files.
        
        
        0.5.2 (2011-08-25)
        ------------------
        
        - implement the script recipe which I already added in z3c.recipe.dev. Just for
          provide a complete recipe library
        
        - implemented environment support for p01.recipe.setup:paste
        
        
        0.5.1 (2011-08-13)
        ------------------
        
        - added paste recipe
