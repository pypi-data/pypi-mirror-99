Description: # bounded-prescience
        This repo contains code for the paper Shielding Atari Games with Bounded Prescience (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08153) by Mirco Giacobbe, Hosein Hasanbeig, Hjalmar Wijk and Daniel Kroening. In addition to replicating the experiments in the paper and the bounded prescience shield, the repo allows the creation of property-labelled versions of the standard Atari gym environments which can expose safety information for other agents and policies.
        ## Installation
        The prescience package needs to be installed through pip:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/HjalmarWijk/bounded-prescience.git
        cd bounded-prescience
        pip3 install .
        ```
        or alternatively:
        ```
        pip3 install git+https://github.com/HjalmarWijk/bounded-prescience.git
        ```

        To test properties use the test\_property.py script with flags --env [Game name] --prop [Property name]
        
        This simulates a random agent and logs violations. To evaluate properties with human play, use --human flag (requires pygame). 
        
        ## Verification
        
        To check properties for the 9 pre-trained agents evaluated in the paper under a variety of settings see the script check\_noops.py
        To run the ChainerRL agents you first need to download them by running download\_models.py (the Atari Zoo agents download dynamically).
        The scripts chainer\_no\_shield.sh and atari\_zoo\_no\_shield.sh run all the agents for all propertiesm and write results as a csv in the results folder. Note that Atari Zoo agents need Tensorflow 1 (and AtariZoo) installed, while ChainerRL agents needs Tensorflow 2 and ChainerRL. 
        
        ## Shielding
        
        To check properties using prescience shielding use the --lookahead flag for check\_noops.py
        The shield scripts run this check for all algorithms, properties and shield depths up to 5.
