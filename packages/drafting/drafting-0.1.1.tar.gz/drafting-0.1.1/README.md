# Drafting

## Features

- Geometric primitives (`drafting/geometry`)
- Color primitives for easy color manipulation (`drafting/color`)
- Fluent-programming `RecordingPen` subclass (`drafting/pens`) with common pen operations & a DrawBot variant (`drafting/pens/drawbotpen`)
- Symbolic shorthand language for vector-drawing-from-code (APL-inspired) (`drafting/sh`)


## Why?

All formerly part of [Coldtype](https://coldtype.goodhertz.com), but broken out into an independent library for easier integration in programs like DrawBot and (in the future) Blender.
