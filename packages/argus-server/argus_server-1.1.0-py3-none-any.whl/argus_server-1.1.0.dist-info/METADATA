Argus is a platform for aggregating incidents across network management systems, and
sending notifications to users. Users create notification profiles that define which
incidents they subscribe to.

This repository hosts the backend built with Django. There is also a
[REACT SPA frontend](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus-frontend).

See also the the [Python client library](https://github.com/Uninett/pyargus).

## Installation

There are several ways to install Argus.

### Prerequisites

#### Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* pip

#### Optional requirements

* **Redis**
  is recommended if you are going to run the frontend.
  Redis backs the websockets, in order to push realtime updates to the frontend.
* [Argus-frontend](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus-frontend/)
* PostgreSQL
* Docker and docker-compose to run Argus in Docker

#### Optional: Dataporten registration

Dataporten authentication is supported by Argus and can be used to log into
Argus-frontend.
Refer to the [Dataporten](http://argus-server.rtfd.io/en/latest/dataporten.html) section of the documentation to learn
about Dataporten registration, and how to set it up with Argus.

### Install Argus using pip

You can also install Argus with `pip` via PyPI. The package name is `argus-server`:
```console
$ pip install argus-server
```

If you are using the PyPI package in production, please note: The file
`requirements.txt` contains the versions of dependencies that the release was
tested on.
To update all the dependencies to recent versions, use `pip-compile`:

```console
$ pip install pip-tools
$ pip-compile -o your-updated-requirements.txt
$ pip install --upgrade -r your-updated-requirements.txt
```

Now change and adapt [Argus' settings](#settings-in-argus) according to your needs.

Run the initial Argus setup, and make note of the admin password that is generated:

```console
$ python manage.py initial_setup
******************************************************************************

  Created Argus superuser "admin" with password "2S0qJbjVEew0GunL".

   Please change the password via the admin interface.

******************************************************************************
```

Then run the Argus API server:

```console
$ python manage.py runserver
```

### Setup Argus using Docker Compose

Download the source code first.
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Uninett/Argus.git
$ cd Argus
```

Running Argus with docker-compose is as simple as
```console
$ docker-compose up
```

Run the initial Argus setup, and make note of the admin password that is generated:

```console
$ docker-compose exec api django-admin initial_setup
******************************************************************************

  Created Argus superuser "admin" with password "ns6bfoKquW12koIP".

   Please change the password via the admin interface.

******************************************************************************
```


You will find Argus running at http://localhost:8000/.

## Settings in Argus

Site-specific settings can either be set using environment variables, using a
`settings.py` file, or a combination of both.

For more information on both methods and a list of the settings, consult the
documentation section on
[site-specific settings](http://argus-server.rtfd.io/en/latest/site-specific-settings.html).


## Running Argus in development

### Step 1: Installation

You can use docker-compose to conveniently setup a complete dev environment for Argus,
including PostgreSQL. Instructions
[are provided above](#setup-argus-using-docker-compose).

To do a manual install instead, follow these steps.

Download the source code first.
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Uninett/Argus.git
$ cd Argus
```

We recommend using virtualenv or virtaulenvwrapper to create
a place to stash Argus' dependencies.

Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Argus' requirements into the virtual env.
```console
$ pip install -r requirements-django30.txt
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

### Step 2: Setting environment variables and Django settings

Copy the `cmd.sh-template` to `cmd.sh` and make it executable
```console
$ cp cmd.sh-template cmd.sh
$ chmod u+x cmd.sh
```
Now set the environment variables in the file using an editor.

Required settings in `cmd.sh` are

- `DATABASE_URL`,
- `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` and
- `SECRET_KEY`.

The `DATAPORTEN` variables are optional. Refer to the dataporten section of
[setting site-specific settings](http://argus-server.rtfd.io/en/latest/site-specific-settings.html) for details.

`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` can be set to `argus.site.settings.dev`.

If you need more complex settings than environment variables and ``cmd.sh`` can provide,
we recommend having a `localsettings.py` in the same directory as `manage.py` with any
overrides.

Refer to the [development notes](http://argus-server.rtfd.io/en/latest/development.html) for further details and
useful hints on managing Argus in development mode.

### Step 3: Run Argus in development

Afterwards, run the initial Argus setup and start the server.
```console
$ python manage.py initial_setup
$ python manage.py runserver
```

You will find Argus running at http://localhost:8000/.

### Code style

Argus uses black as a source code formatter. Black will automatically install
with the [dev requirements](requirements/dev.txt).

A pre-commit hook will format new code automatically before committing.
To enable this pre-commit hook, run

```console
$ pre-commit install
```


## Running tests

Given that Argus is installed and configured as described above,
this command is the most basic option to run the tests.
```console
$ python manage.py test
```

If you have installed `tox`, the following command will
test Argus code against several Django versions, several Python versions, and
automatically compute code coverage.
```console
$ tox
```
An [HTML coverage report](htmlcov/index.html) will be generated.
Refer to the [tox.ini](tox.ini) file for further options.

### Mock data

Fill the database with mock data with the management command `create_fake_incidents`:

```sh
$ python manage.py create_fake_incidents
```

See the inbuilt help for flags and toggles:

```sh
$ python manage.py create_fake_incidents --help
```

Since the current default number of shown incidents in the frintend is 10, you
might want to create just more than 10 incidents in one go, with the `-n`-flag:

```sh
$ python manage.py create_fake_incidents -n 15
```

(The same command is well-suited to manually test the notification system: Make
a filter that matches fake incidents, for instance by setting `source` to
`argus`, and create a single fake incident by omitting the `-n`-flag.)
