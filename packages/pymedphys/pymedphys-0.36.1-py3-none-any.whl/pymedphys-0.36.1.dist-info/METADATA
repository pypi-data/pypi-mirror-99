.. START_OF_DOCS_IMPORT

**A community effort to develop an open standard library for Medical Physics
in Python. We build high quality, transparent software together via peer review
and open source distribution. Open code is better science.**

What is PyMedPhys?
==================

PyMedPhys is an open-source Medical Physics python library built by an open
community that values and prioritises code sharing, review, improvement, and
learning from each other. It is inspired by the collaborative work of our
physics peers in astronomy and the `Astropy Project`_. PyMedPhys is available
on `PyPI`_ and `GitHub`_.

.. _`Astropy Project`: http://www.astropy.org/
.. _`PyPI`: https://pypi.org/project/pymedphys/
.. _`GitHub`: https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys

Beta level of development
*************************

PyMedPhys is currently within the ``beta`` stage of its life-cycle. It will
stay in this stage until the version number leaves ``0.x.x`` and enters
``1.x.x``. While PyMedPhys is in ``beta`` stage, **no API is guaranteed to be
stable from one release to the next.** In fact, it is very likely that the
entire API will change multiple times before a ``1.0.0`` release. In practice,
this means that upgrading ``pymedphys`` to a new version will possibly break
any code that was using the old version of pymedphys. We try to be abreast of
this by providing details of any breaking changes from one release to the next
within the `Release Notes`_.

Community
**************

PyMedPhys has a `Discourse community <https://pymedphys.discourse.group/>`_
to both help you find your feet using PyMedPhys and to facilitate collaboration
and general discussion. Please reach out over there and we'd love to get to
know you!

Documentation
=============

The PyMedPhys documentation is split into five categories:

1. `App Users Guide`_: for those who only wish to use ready-made PyMedPhys
   tools.
2. `Library Users Guide`_: for those building their own Python apps, scripts
   and other tools who wish to incorporate elements of the PyMedPhys library.
3. `CLI Users Guide`_: for those who wish to use PyMedPhys' ready-made command
   line interface (e.g. to help automate existing workflows with minimal
   programming).
4. `Contributors Guide`_: for those who wish to make new contributions to
   either the PyMedPhys library or the PyMedPhys app.
5. `General`_: Material that may apply to any visitor to PyMedPhys.
