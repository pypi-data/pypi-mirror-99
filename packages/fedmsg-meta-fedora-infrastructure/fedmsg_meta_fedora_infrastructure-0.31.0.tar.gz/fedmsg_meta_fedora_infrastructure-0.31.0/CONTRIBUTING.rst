Contributing
============

If you're submitting patches to fedmsg, please observe the following:

- Check that your python code is `PEP8-compliant
  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.  There is a `pep8 tool
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_ that can automatically check
  your source.  Bind it to a key in vim?
- Check that your code doesn't break the test suite.  Instructions for running
  the test suite can be found in :doc:`development`.
- If you are adding new code, please write tests for them in ``fedmsg/tests``.
- If your change warrants a modification to the docs in ``doc/`` or any
  docstrings in ``fedmsg/`` please make that modification.

    ...all I wanted to do was submit a patch!


Don't worry.  If you have a contribution but the above guidelines are too
much to handle, just stop by ``#fedora-apps`` on freenode and let us know.
