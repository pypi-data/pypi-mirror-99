        Tests
        -----
        
        If you're a developer and want to run the tests, you need to edit
        `tests/.env` and define the following variables according to your
        environment:
        
        * `JOHN_PATH` (path to `john` binary)
        * `HASHCAT_PATH` (path to `hashcat` binary)
        * `DOMAIN` (FQDN of a test domain)
        * `DOMAINUSER` (name of one of its domain admins)
        * `DOMAINPASS` (domain admin password)
        * `HOST` (FQDN of a domain controller in the test domain)
        
        If you don't have a test domain, you can use the docker-compose file in
        `tests/docker` to run a Samba DC (`docker-compose run --service-ports dc`).
        Inside the file you will find the values you need. You should also create an
        entry for the FQDN in your `/etc/hosts`.
