Description: # Tartiflette Middleware
        
        Framework to facilitate the creation of middleware for [Tartiflette](https://tartiflette.io/) with
        resolver context variable assignment using python context managers. 
        
        Allows for processing of request/response headers, dependent on the
        http server you're using.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install tartiflette-middleware
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        This requires:
        1. Creation of your middleware.
        1. Configuration of your middleware in your application.
        1. Update your resolvers to access your data.
        
        ### 1 - Creation of your middleware
        Create a context manager to run on each request.
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        from tartiflette_middleware import BaseMiddleware
        
        class MyMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
            # required short arbitrary unique middleware label
            label = 'MyMware'
            
            def __init__(self, my_middleware_params):
                BaseMiddleware.__init__(self)
                # do things necessary for repeated use across all of the requests, e.g.
                # configure factories
        
            async def __aenter__(self):
                # provide the data or method to be used in all queries for a single
                # request. 
                your_method_or_data = ...
                # store the data/method to be reused for this request
                await self.store_request_data(your_method_or_data)
        
            async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
                # optional: for if you need to do something when the request is
                # completed
                data = await self.get_request_data()
                data.close_or_whatever()
        ```
        
        There are more examples in the examples directory including one with access to
        AIOHTTP request headers.
        
        You can set the response http status using something like:
        
        ```python
        async def __aenter__(self):
            self.status = 401
        ```
        
        ### 2 - Configuration of your middleware in your app
        
        Currently only AIOHTTP is supported but the library is extensible if others
        would like to submit a pull request to support other servers that Tartiflette
        supports.
        
        Limited AIOHTTP setup example, imports and configuration kept to middleware specific
        details:
        
        ```python
        from tartiflette_middleware import Middleware, server
        import MyMiddleware     # your Middleware as defined earlier
        
        my_middleware = Middleware(
            context_manager=MyMiddleware(
                my_middleware_params={},
            ),
            server_middleware=server.aiohttp
        )
        
        app = web.Application(middlewares=[
            my_middleware.middleware
        ])
        ctx = {
            'my_session_service': my_middleware.service,
        }
        web.run_app(
            register_graphql_handlers(
                # your configuration
                executor_context=ctx,
            )
        )
        ```
        
        ### 3 - Access data in your resolvers' context
        
        Works in queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
        
        ```python
        @Resolver('Query.whatever')
        async def resolve_query_user_login(parent, args, ctx, info):
            my_data = await ctx['my_session_service']()
        ```
