    Adds two new `oslo_messaging_notifications` drivers:

    * `prometheus_exporter`: the sensor data of each baremetal node is
      transformed into Prometheus metrics when possible and stored in a file.

    * `file_exporter`: stores the raw sensor data of each baremetal node in
      a file. It can be used to see how is the format of the data for a
      specific driver before creating the parser for it.

    To use any of the driver it's necessary to update the `ironic.conf` with
    the following configurations:

    .. code-block:: text

      [conductor]
      send_sensor_data=true

      [oslo_messaging_notifications]
      driver= <driver>
      transport_url=fake://
      location= <absolute path for directory>


    The files created by the drivers will always contain the latest
    information about the node.
