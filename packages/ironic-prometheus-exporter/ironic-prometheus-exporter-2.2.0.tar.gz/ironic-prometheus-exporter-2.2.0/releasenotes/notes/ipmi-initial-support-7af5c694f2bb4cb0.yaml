    Adds the initial support to parse ipmi metrics based on the following
    payloads: `Management`, `Temperature`, `System`, `Current`, `Version`,
    `Memory`, `Power`, `Watchdog2` and `Fan`.
    The metrics are generated in a format that is valid to be consumed by
    Prometheus by using the `prometheus client`.
