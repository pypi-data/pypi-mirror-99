Description:      The API used exclusively by the MAGIC Dashboard for populating charts, graphs, tables, etc... on the dashboard.  # API Conventions  **All responses** MUST be of type &#x60;APIResponse&#x60; and contain the following fields:  * &#x60;api_version&#x60; |  The current api version * &#x60;success&#x60; | Boolean value indicating if the operation succeeded. * &#x60;code&#x60; | Status code. Typically corresponds to the HTTP status code.  * &#x60;message&#x60; | A human readable message providing more details about the operation. Can be null or empty.  **Successful operations** MUST return a &#x60;SuccessResponse&#x60;, which extends &#x60;APIResponse&#x60; by adding:  * &#x60;data&#x60; | Properties containing the response object. * &#x60;success&#x60; | MUST equal True  When returning objects from a successful response, the &#x60;data&#x60; object SHOULD contain a property named after the requested object type. For example, the &#x60;/alerts&#x60; endpoint should return a response object with &#x60;data.alerts&#x60;. This property SHOULD  contain a list of the returned objects. For the &#x60;/alerts&#x60; endpoint, the &#x60;data.alerts&#x60; property contains a list of MagicAlerts objects. See the &#x60;/alerts&#x60; endpoint documentation for an example.  **Failed Operations** MUST return an &#x60;ErrorResponse&#x60;, which extends &#x60;APIResponse&#x60; by adding:  * &#x60;success&#x60; | MUST equal False.   # noqa: E501
