    Cythereal Dashboard API

     The API used exclusively by the MAGIC Dashboard for populating charts, graphs, tables, etc... on the dashboard.  # API Conventions  **All responses** MUST be of type `APIResponse` and contain the following fields:  * `api_version` |  The current api version * `success` | Boolean value indicating if the operation succeeded. * `code` | Status code. Typically corresponds to the HTTP status code.  * `message` | A human readable message providing more details about the operation. Can be null or empty.  **Successful operations** MUST return a `SuccessResponse`, which extends `APIResponse` by adding:  * `data` | Properties containing the response object. * `success` | MUST equal True  When returning objects from a successful response, the `data` object SHOULD contain a property named after the requested object type. For example, the `/alerts` endpoint should return a response object with `data.alerts`. This property SHOULD  contain a list of the returned objects. For the `/alerts` endpoint, the `data.alerts` property contains a list of MagicAlerts objects. See the `/alerts` endpoint documentation for an example.  **Failed Operations** MUST return an `ErrorResponse`, which extends `APIResponse` by adding:  * `success` | MUST equal False.   # noqa: E501
