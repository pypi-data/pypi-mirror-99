Isoplot
=======

**Isoplot is a software for the visualisation of MS data from C13 labelling experiments.**
It takes as input corrected MS data from `IsoCor <https://isocor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ in csv or tsv format.
Isoplot outputs static and interactive plots that are then used for quality assessment, biological interpretation, 
project reports, published papers and so forth. 

It is one of the routine tools used on the `MetaToul platform <https://www6.toulouse.inrae.fr/metatoul>`_.

The code is open-source, and available on GitHub under a GPLv3 license.

The documentation relative to Isoplot's installation and usage can be found on `ReadTheDocs <https://isoplot.readthedocs.io/>`_.
