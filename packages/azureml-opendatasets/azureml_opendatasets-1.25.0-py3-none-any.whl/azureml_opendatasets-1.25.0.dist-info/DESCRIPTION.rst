This package provides a set of APIs to consume Azure Open Datasets. 

In general, it allows users to turn the open datasets into both SPARK and Pandas dataframe, 
with filters that are commonly applied to each specific dataset. 

For some of the open datasets, it provides enricher capability to join with other data. For example, 
you can join your data with weather data by lat/long/zipcode + time quite easily.
