    When upgrading from Ocata (v4), existing Port Chains that have been
    deployed using Port Pair Groups that combine Port Pairs of different
    correlation types (within the same Port Pair Group) will render differently
    when using the OVS Driver. Whereas before all the Port Pairs would have
    their correlation ignored if at least one of them had ``correlation=None``,
    now the OVS driver will render each differently. Recreation of each Port
    Pair Group (that have inconsistent Port Pairs' correlations) is
    recommended - and only Port Pairs sharing the same correlation type
    will now be supported.

    When creating Port Pair Groups, validation of each Port Pair's
    correlation type will now occur. Every Port Pair needs to share the same
    correlation type when they get attached to a specific Port Pair Group.
    This guarantees homogeneity in the composition of a Port Pair Group and
    clarifies the definition and feature set of each hop of a chain.
