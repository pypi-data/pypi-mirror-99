Installing software environments locally
========================================

Motivation
==========

When performing distributed computation with Dask, you’ll create a :class:`distributed.Client`
object to connect your local Python process (e.g. your laptop) to your remote Dask cluster
(e.g. running on AWS). Dask ``Client`` s are the user-facing entry point for submitting tasks to
a Dask cluster. When using a ``Client`` to submit tasks to your cluster, Dask will package up and send data,
functions, and other Python objects needed for your computations *from* your local Python process
where your ``Client`` is running *to* your remote Dask cluster in order for them to be executed.

This means that if you want to run a function on your Dask cluster, for example NumPy’s :func:`numpy.mean`
function, then you must have NumPy installed in your local Python process so Dask can send the ``numpy.mean``
function from your local Dask ``Client`` to the workers in your Dask cluster. For this and other reasons,
it’s recommended to have the same libraries installed on both your local machine and on the remote
workers in your cluster.

As such, Coiled software environments can be installed locally to have a consistent set of libraries
between your local environment and the environment your cluster is running in.


Install Coiled software environments locally
============================================

You can install a Coiled software environment locally using the ``coiled install`` command line tool.
``coiled install`` installs an existing Coiled software environment on your machine as
a local conda environment. For example, to install the ``coiled/default`` software environment
locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create local version of the coiled/default software environment
    $ coiled install coiled/default
    $ conda activate coiled-coiled-default

The ``coiled/default`` name after ``coiled install`` specifies which Coiled
software environment to install locally. Generally Coiled software environments
are specified in the form of "<coiled-account-name>/<software-environment-name>".
So in the above example we're telling ``coiled install`` to create the Coiled
software environment named "default" in the "coiled" account locally.

Note that currently ``coiled install`` requires conda to be installed locally and does not support
software environments with custom Docker images.
