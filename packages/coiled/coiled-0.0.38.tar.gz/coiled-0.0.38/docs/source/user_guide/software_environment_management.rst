Managing software environments

Managing software environments involves four pieces of functionality: creating new software environments,
updating existing software environments, listing available software environments, and deleting software environments.

Creating software environments is discussed in detail in the :ref:`creating-software-environments` page.
The other software management operations are discussed here.


Updating software environments
------------------------------

You can update an existing software environment, for example to add a new conda package, by calling
``coiled.create_software_environment`` with the name of the software environment you want to update and
the new specification for the software environment.

If the inputs to ``coiled.create_software_environment`` have changed since the last time it was called for
a given software environment, the corresponding software environment will be rebuilt using the new inputs
and any future uses of the software environment will use the updated version. Repeated calls to
``coiled.create_software_environment`` with the same inputs are a no-op.

You can't update the software environment being used on an already running cluster. The cluster must first be closed and then 
restarted to use any updates made to a software environment.


Listing software environments
-----------------------------

The :meth:`coiled.list_software_environments` function will list all available
software environments:

.. code-block:: python

    coiled.list_software_environments()

There is also a ``account=`` keyword argument which lets you specify the account which you
want to list software environments for.


Deleting software environments
------------------------------

The :meth:`coiled.delete_software_environment` function can be used to delete
individual software environments. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    coiled.delete_software_environment(name="alice/my-conda-env")

will delete the software environment named "my-conda-env" in the Coiled account named "alice".
