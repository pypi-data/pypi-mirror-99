Kubernetes Backend
==================

.. note::

    Kubernetes support is currently experimental with new features under active development.

.. note::
    Software environments are not yet fully supported and we recommend building your own
    Docker images for the moment.

You can have Coiled launch computations on a Kubernetes cluster that you control.
This is a good way to run Coiled on other cloud providers or on-prem infrastructure.
In this situation you provide Coiled a
`Kubernetes configuration <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/>`_,
or ``kubeconfig``, file that grants access to a particular namespace in a Kubernetes cluster
(the following two sections discuss how to generate this ``kubeconfig`` file).
The ``kubeconfig`` file and namespace can then be added to the "Cloud Backend Options"
section of the Account page of your Coiled account. Once this is done, any clusters you create
with Coiled will be launched in your Kubernetes cluster.

.. tip::
   
    Once a Coiled cluster is up and running, any issues normally captured by Dask's
    logging system will be available as usual. However, Coiled does not collect logs related to
    Kubernetes resources failing to launch on your k8s cluster (e.g. a pod which launches a Dask worker
    doesn't run successfully). The most common example of this is if a Kubernetes cluster does not have
    sufficient resources to start the pods you request.


Local authentication
""""""""""""""""""""

Cloud providers (e.g. Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Kubernetes Service) offer
a way, through their command line interfaces (e.g. ``gcloud``, ``az``), to 
generate a local ``kubeconfig`` file which is used to authenticate your machine.

Below you'll find information on how to authenticate your local machine for GKE and AKS.

.. tabbed:: GKE
   :selected:

    To generate a Kubernetes configuration file with the ``gcloud`` CLI for GKE:

    .. code-block:: bash

        gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name>
    
    For more information, see the
    `GKE documentation <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl>`_.

    .. note::

        ``gcloud`` will generate a ``kubeconfig`` file with short-lived, temporary credentials.
        In order to give Coiled sustained access to your cluster, you must also follow the
        step in the :ref:`next section <create-kubeconfig>` which generates a ``kubeconfig``
        file with long-lived credentials.

.. tabbed:: AKS

    To generate a Kubernetes configuration file with the ``az`` CLI for AKS:

    .. code-block:: bash

        az aks get-credentials --resource-group <group-name> --name <cluster-name>

    For more information, see the
    `AKS documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough#connect-to-the-cluster>`_.

.. _create-kubeconfig:

Configure restricted access (optional)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The configuration file cloud providers generate often grant admin access to your full Kubernetes cluster.
This level of access is not required to run Coiled on your cluster so we recommend restricting the permissions
given to Coiled.

To accommodate this, Coiled provides a ``coiled create-kubeconfig``
command line interface to generate a separate ``kubeconfig`` file with restricted access to your cluster.
Running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ coiled create-kubeconfig

locally will create a new ``kubeconfig`` file in the current working directory which grants minimal
access to a single ``coiled`` namespace within the cluster.

Note that using ``coiled create-kubeconfig`` requires you to have ``kubectl``
`installed <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`_ locally, and to have `sufficient
permissions <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding>`__ (e.g. in Google Cloud this requires the ``roles/container.admin`` or ``roles/container.clusterAdmin`` IAM roles)
