    Parameters
    ----------
    coiled_uri
        Identifier of the software environment to use, in the format (<account>/)<name>. If the software environment
        is owned by the same account as that passed into "account", the (<account>/) prefix is optional.

        For example, suppose your account is "wondercorp", but your friends at "friendlycorp" have an environment
        named "xgboost" that you want to use; you can specify this with "friendlycorp/xgboost". If you simply
        entered "xgboost", this is shorthand for "wondercorp/xgboost".

        The "name" portion of (<account>/)<name> can only contain ASCII letters, hyphens and underscores.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import coiled
    >>> coiled.install("coiled/default")
