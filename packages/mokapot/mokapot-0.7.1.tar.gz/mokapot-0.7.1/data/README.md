# Data for Examples and Testing

This directory contains the data files that we use to test mokapot functionality
and provide examples in the documentation.

These are where the files came from:

- `msfragger.pepXML` was downloaded directly from PRIDE project PXD020243. It is
  the results from an MSFragger search and was originally named
  `MSB32231WmutBand_01.pepXML`. [FTP](http://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2020/10/PXD020243/MSB32231WmutBand_01.pepXML)[Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-020-0512-7)
