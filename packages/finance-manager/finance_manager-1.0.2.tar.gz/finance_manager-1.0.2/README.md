# Finance Manager
Managing HEI forecasting and budget setting data. 

This python command-line app is designed to be used by system admin to maintain and run a forecasting and budget setting system. End-users use a Power App to actually interface. 

The long-term aim is to replace the PowerApp with a Flask application, which will also integrate monitoring of actuals.
