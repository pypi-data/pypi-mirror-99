"""Eigen based implementation of differential evolution using the DE/best/1 strategy.
    Uses three deviations from the standard DE algorithm:
    a) temporal locality introduced in 
        https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309179699_Differential_evolution_for_protein_folding_optimization_based_on_a_three-dimensional_AB_off-lattice_model
    b) reinitialization of individuals based on their age.
    c) oscillating CR/F parameters."""

    C++ Differential Evolution implementation called via ctypes.
     
    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        The objective function to be minimized.
            ``fun(x, *args) -> float``
        where ``x`` is an 1-D array with shape (n,) and ``args``
        is a tuple of the fixed parameters needed to completely
        specify the function.
    dim : int
        dimension of the argument of the objective function
    bounds : sequence or `Bounds`, optional
        Bounds on variables. There are two ways to specify the bounds:
            1. Instance of the `scipy.Bounds` class.
            2. Sequence of ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in `x`. None
               is used to specify no bound.
    popsize : int, optional
        Population size.
    max_evaluations : int, optional
        Forced termination after ``max_evaluations`` function evaluations.
    stop_fitness : float, optional 
         Limit for fitness value. If reached minimize terminates.
    keep = float, optional
        changes the reinitialization probability of individuals based on their age. Higher value
        means lower probablity of reinitialization.
    f = float, optional
        The mutation constant. In the literature this is also known as differential weight, 
        being denoted by F. Should be in the range [0, 2].
    cr = float, optional
        The recombination constant. Should be in the range [0, 1]. 
        In the literature this is also known as the crossover probability.     
    rg = numpy.random.Generator, optional
        Random generator for creating random guesses.
    runid : int, optional
        id used to identify the run for debugging / logging. 
            
    Returns
    -------
    res : scipy.OptimizeResult
        The optimization result is represented as an ``OptimizeResult`` object.
        Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, 
        ``fun`` the best function value, 
        ``nfev`` the number of function evaluations,
        ``nit`` the number of iterations,
        ``success`` a Boolean flag indicating if the optimizer exited successfully. """
