## Overview

Allow specifying arbitrary handlers which execute as part of the deployment process and trigger them before/after resources or stacks.

## Usage

> Hypothetical README

You can trigger the execution of arbitrary AWS Lambda functions before or after resources or groups of resources are provisioned using the Triggers API.

The library includes constructs that represent different triggers. The `BeforeCreate` and `AfterCreate` constructs can be used to trigger a handler before/after a set of resources have been created.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
triggers.AfterCreate(self, "InvokeAfter",
    resources=[resource1, resource2, stack, ...],
    handler=my_lambda_function
)
```

Similarly, `triggers.BeforeCreate` can be used to set up a "before" trigger.

Where `resources` is a list of **construct scopes** which determine when `handler` is invoked. Scopes can be either specific resources or composite constructs (in which case all the resources in the construct will be used as a group). The scope can also be a `Stack`, in which case the trigger will apply to all the resources within the stack (same as any composite construct). All scopes must roll up to the same stack.

Let's look at an example. Say we want to publish a notification to an SNS topic that says "hello, topic!" after the topic is created.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# define a topic
topic = sns.Topic(self, "MyTopic")

# define a lambda function which publishes a message to the topic
publisher = NodeJsFunction(self, "PublishToTopic")
publisher.add_environment("TOPIC_ARN", topic.topic_arn)
publisher.add_environment("MESSAGE", "Hello, topic!")
topic.grant_publish(publisher)

# trigger the lambda function after the topic is created
triggers.AfterCreate(self, "SayHello",
    scopes=[topic],
    handler=publisher
)
```

## Requirements

* One-off exec before/after resource/s are created (`Trigger.AfterCreate`).
* Additional periodic execution after deployment (`repeatOnSchedule`).
* Async checks (`retryWithTImeout`)
* Execute on updates (bind logical ID to hash of CFN properties of triggered resource)
* Execute shell command inside a Docker image

## Use Cases

Here are some examples of use cases for triggers:

* **Intrinsic validations**: execute a check to verify that a resource or set of resources have been deployed correctly

  * Test connections to external systems (e.g. security tokens are valid)
  * Verify integration between resources is working as expected
  * Execute as one-off and also periodically after deployment
  * Wait for data to start flowing (e.g. wait for a metric) before deployment is successful
* **Data priming**: add data to resources after they are created

  * CodeCommit repo + initial commit
  * Database + test data for development
* Check prerequisites before depoyment

  * Account limits
  * Availability of external services
* Connect to other accounts
