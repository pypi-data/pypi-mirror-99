        PURPOSE
        -------
        
        rebookmaker - an open source (MIT-licensed) re-implementation of
        Marcelo Lira’s ( @setanta ) ebookmaker.
        
        EPUB is a popular and open file format standard for electronic books (see
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB for more information about it). What
        rebookmaker (= "re-ebook-maker") does is compile a definition of the
        book inside a JSON file along with some input HTML and image files into an
        .epub.
        
        See:
        
        * https://github.com/setanta/ebookmaker/ - does not have an explicit
          licence, which prompted this re-implementation.
        * https://pypi.org/project/ebookmaker/ - GPLv3 by Project Gutenberg and
          incompatible with @setanta 's .
        
        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        pip3 install rebookmaker
        
        NOTES
        -----
        
        Since the name "ebookmaker" was taken on pypi and it is common courtesy to
        change the name, I picked "rebookmaker" since it was available
        on pypi and as a pun on `reboots in fiction <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_%28fiction%29>`_
        because it was a rewrite.
        
        The issue where I requested an explicit licensing of the original
        project is here:
        https://github.com/setanta/ebookmaker/issues/8 but I have yet to receive a reply.
        
        You can find some examples for valid input by perusing the code in
        https://github.com/shlomif/screenplays-common and
        https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage . Preparing some less
        generic examples is on my TODO list.
        
        This project aims for compatibility with setanta's project, but some functionality
        may be still missing and I also added some new one.
        
        Samples:
        --------
        
        * https://github.com/shlomif/english-humanity-the-movie-rebookmaker-example - under CC-BY-SA.
        
        Similar Projects:
        -----------------
        
        * http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/epub/README - DocBook 5 can be
          converted to EPUB.
        * https://github.com/shlomif/cookiecutter--shlomif-latemp-sites - contains some custom XSLT
          stylesheets for reproducible builds and other features.
        * https://pypi.org/project/ebookmaker/ - by Project Gutenberg: accepts a different input.
        * https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/strip-nondeterminism - allow for reproducible
          builds EPUBs.
