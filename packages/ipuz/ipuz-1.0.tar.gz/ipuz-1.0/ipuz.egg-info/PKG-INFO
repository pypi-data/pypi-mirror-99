Description: ipuz
        ====
        
        Python library for reading and writing ipuz puzzle files. The specification
        for the ipuz file format can be found at: http://www.ipuz.org/. The ipuz file
        format supports representing various types of puzzles, including crossword,
        sudoku and word search. This Python library provides validation and wrapping
        around the puzzle data.
        
        As the puzzle is inherently JSON data it is the application's responsibility
        to ensure that the JSON satisfies the constraints of the PuzzleKind prior to
        writing the puzzle. This library provides validation and additional
        functionality that you might want to use.
        
        The library supports Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.
