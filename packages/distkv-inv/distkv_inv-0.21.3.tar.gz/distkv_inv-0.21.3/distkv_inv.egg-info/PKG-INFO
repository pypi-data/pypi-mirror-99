Description: =======
        DistInv
        =======
        
        DistInv is a link between DistKV and your network infrastructure.
        
        DistInv knows about hosts, ports, VLANs, (sub)networks, cables.
        
        It stores
        
           * which VLAN a network is in
           * which network a host belongs to
           * which port is plugged into what
           * which groups a host belongs to
           * where a host is located
        
        This allows you to
        
           * record which systems are where (surprisingly difficult â€¦)
           * auto-generate (part of) your Ansible inventory
           * display which VLANs need to be configured on a switch port
           * generate a network link path from A to B
           * auto-update DNS entries when hosts are added, moved, or modified
