    Blood and Pool management is an important part of V:tES, but I notice not every player quite understands it. I use
    all forms of counters, beads, pebbles or whatever to represent blood and pool but often use the term beads to refer
    to blood and pool, as often how many beads your prey has is more relevant than their location.

    The way I see it, there are two ways to play this, either beads matter or pool matters. If you’re playing the new
    {{ v5_malkavian }} (or any other kind of {{ stealth_bleed }}), you won’t care about the
    blood on your prey’s vampires since you’re planning to walk right by them, and if they do catch you... well, you
    aren’t exactly going to be taking beads from them in combat! However, if you’re playing the {{ v5_tremere }},
    you’ll be taking beads wherever they are. Both decks oust their prey by bleeding with {{ govern_the_unaligned }},
    but they work very differently.

        You bleed with {{ alexander_silverson }} using {{ govern_the_unaligned }} and your prey blocks. You play
        {{ bonding }}, making it a bleed for 4 and increasing the stealth. If your prey has intercept,
        you need more stealth or you’re in trouble. Your best case scenario in a combat is that you maneuver to long
        and wave at your opponent, or you trade hand strikes for one. This means that you lose exactly the same amount
        of beads as your prey, but you don’t care about beads, you care exclusively about pool and your prey didn’t
        lose any.

        Let’s look at the same scenario. You bleed with {{ trevon_parker }} using {{ govern_the_unaligned }}
        and your prey blocks. You play {{ bonding }}, making it a bleed for 4 and increasing the stealth.
        If your opponent blocks, you don’t much care. The Tremere deck actually has a combat package, and you may be
        surprised at how effective it is. You do one of two things, first is use a {{ magnum }} if you’ve equipped
        it, maneuver to long and shoot for 2. This means whether you resolve the {{ govern }} or not, you’re taking
        2 more beads from your prey than you’re losing. Playing a {{ theft_of_vitae }} at close yields a similar result.
        You lose 1, but take two of theirs.

    The examples above show the key difference in the strategies. The {{ stealth_bleed }} deck has the advantage
    of being able to circumvent all the beads piled up on their prey’s vampires, but relies completely on being able to
    resolve their actions. The Tremere deck uses a tactic known as {{ grinding }}, wherein whatever the result
    is of the action, you take more beads than you lose.

<h2>{{ _('Why not just ignore blood and go straight for pool?') }}</h2>
<p>
    {% trans trimmed %}
    Well, both strategies have their flaws. The biggest flaw with the Grinder strategy is that if you keep getting
    yourself into fights, you run the risk of losing them. Combat is like a whole other game within the game, and
    anything could happen. Combats get messy, and a lot of players can get excited and torpor your vampires because they
    want to cycle cards or they don’t realise how it’ll impact table flow, or simply because you deserve it and they
    need to.

    %}
    Stealth & Bleed decks mostly avoid the complexities of combat, and have the huge advantage of being able to ignore
    the beads on vampires. However, this in itself becomes a huge flaw. Refusing to interact with your prey’s vampires
    means they have all the blood they need, and you’ll find yourself bleeding the hell out of your grandprey as you
    hear the word {{ deflection }} said over and over. Grinder decks aren’t as bothered by {{ deflection }} since it
    still costs their prey a bead and they use very little stealth, meaning their grandprey can block. I could talk for
    a while about how not planning for combat leaves you vulnerable to {{ bum_s_rush }} decks or how you’re in trouble
    when The Wall finally catches you, but I'm about to tell you the biggest downside... %(villein)s! The brutal truth
    is that you can’t completely ignore the beads on vampires because beads can be moved. {{ leeching }} cards like
    {{ villein }}, {{ blood_doll }}, and so on allow Methuselahs to take that blood back to their pool. Which brings me
    to my next question...

    %}
    I often hear players talk about vampires capacities as a cost, especially amongst players with a history in other
    card games. It’s not quite so clear cut in V:tES, pool isn’t spent to get your crypt out, it’s invested! Sure, there
    are times it can cost, such as crypt accelerant card {{ zillah_s_valley }} meaning you spent 1. But have you spent
    1? You’re balancing what you’ll gain getting the vampire out quicker versus what you’ll lose if you don’t.
    {{ zillah_s_valley }} is usually in decks that run {{ bloat_actions }} like {{ govern_the_unaligned }} or
    {{ parity_shift }}, where you’ll get more back than you paid. The point is, vampires don’t tend to cost you beads,
    and for when you need that blood to become pool, you’ll already have a bunch of cards in your deck to help you do
    that.

        mary=card("Mary Anne Blaire", "Mary")
        %}
        Let’s look at an example of how a vampire can pay for itself and net you beads. You transfer out
        {{ mary_anne_blaire }}, on your next turn you play {{ villein }} taking back 5. Minion phase, you use her
        special ability to put two blood down on a younger uncontrolled vampire, you then {{ freak_drive }}, and then
        {{ govern_the_unaligned }} at superior {{ DOM }}. In this example, 5 of the invested beads are already back in
        your pool, and at the cost of 2 blood, you’ve created 5 more blood on an uncontrolled vampire. With her being a
        10, that means your 4 transfers would get you out whoever you blooded that same turn. {{ mary }} hasn’t cost you
        10 pool, she’s gained you 3 beads and a new vampire.

    There’s a lot of elements to V:tES and many players seem to forget the maths. You need to crunch the numbers, just

        These two cards show the distinct differences in the styles. {{ the_coven }} gives you 2 beads every 5 turns,
        but gives out 8 beads to the table before you get it back. {{ smiling_jack }} takes 4 beads for every 1 you
        spend, but the other players choose where the beads come from. If you’re playing a Stealth & Bleed deck and
        there is a {{ smiling_jack }} on the table, your prey is going to take beads off their vampires and you’re not
        going to see any benefit, but if there’s a {{ coven }} on the table, you’re going to see no downside. This is in
        stark contrast to the Toolbox deck who will decimate their prey with a {{ smiling_jack }} but burn out against
        {{ the_coven }}.

    If you’re planning on building a deck that ignores beads and looks just at pool, you’ll need to plan for it. Make
    sure you hold your {{ sudden_reversal }} or {{ wash }} until your prey tries to leech beads off their vampires,
    otherwise you’re losing your biggest advantage. Pay attention to bead movement over bead gain. For example, if your
    prey plays a {{ parity_shift }} to take 3 pool from your grandprey, it’s still just 3 beads you have to take. If
    it’s the difference between an oust, you’ll want to vote it down, but in other circumstances it could favour you to
    weaken your grandprey (especially if they’re an Auspex {{ AUS }} deck).

    Make sure your prey always loses more beads than you do. Avoid fights you think you’ll lose. The biggest thing I can
    advise here is block your predator only when you need to. It doesn’t matter as much about your predator losing beads
    yet, if you can block a bleed and ping them with a {{ magnum }}, walking away unscathed, then that’s fantastic!
    However, if you’re being bled for one and they have the {{ magnum }}, you’re doubling your bead loss. If you’re
    running cards like {{ the_rack }}, make sure you can protect it! Focus on numbers, an early {{ hunting_ground }}
    is a no brainer as a target for your {{ wash }}. Destroy your predator’s {{ army_of_rats }}. Make sure you keep as
    many beads as you can, and take as many to the left as possible.
