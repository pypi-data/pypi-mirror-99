<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using {{ deep_song }} to rush
    or bleed and a {{ ANI }} combat module with
    {{ carrion_crows }} and {{ aid_from_bats }}.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ nana_buruku }} allow to play a lot of {{ ashur_tablets }}
    for a nice recursion. This lets the deck adapt to the table context while bloating.
</p>
<p>
    {{ fame }} and {{ dragonbound }} are used to improve pool damage.
</p>
<p>
    Using low ad mid capacity vampires let the deck use a decent amout of naked "bleed for 1" actions or
    inferior {{ ani }} {{ deep_song }} to get some pool damage to its prey.
</p>
<p>
    It is a very solid deck, with good defence against the predator and decent pool damage towards its prey.
    Although it is not a very fast damage dealer, rush actions let it control the table nicely.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ powerbase_luanda }} and {{ well_marked }} are nice tools for a rush deck.
    They can be used by both {{ nana_buruku }} and {{ fish }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck does not have a lot of intercept, but plays
    {{ powerbase_montreal }} and {{ the_rack }} nonetheless, relying on the threat of
    a retaliation rush to protect them.
</p>
<p>
    Just including a bit of <em>wakes</em> and some intercept enhancers like
    {{ cats_guidance }} and {{ sense_the_savage_way }}
    keep the other players guessing on wether the deck can block or not.
</p>
<p>
    Getting {{ wider_view }} at some point helps getting rid
    of the spurious {{ nana_buruku }} in crypt.
    She's also only played in 4 copies to avoid jamming the crypt too much;
    other minions are needed for the deck to work well.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Anarch</strong> variant uses {{ anarch_convert }} to make the vampires anarch,
    along {{ anarch_revolt }} to improve pool damage,
    taking down any Anarch vampire on the prey side using rush actions.
    {{ orian_gissler_s_deck }} from the 2018 French NC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Weenie ANI</strong> plays {{ ani }} without
    {{ nana_buruku }} nor
    {{ ashur_tablets }}.
    {{ kim_nilsson_s_deck }} from the 2016 Swedish NC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Toolbox</strong> variant includes more intercept, like
    {{ adam_horvath_s_deck }} from 2010,
    with {{ aranthebes_the_immortal }} and {{ raven_spy }}.
