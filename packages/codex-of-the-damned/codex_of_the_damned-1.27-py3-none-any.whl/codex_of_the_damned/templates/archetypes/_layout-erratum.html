    {{ villein }} has been modified by an errata in June 2018 to limit the blood taken
    to a maximum of 5. It should still be as efficient as ever in this archetype, though.

    {{ parity_shift }} has been modified in the September 2019 <em>errata</em>.
    The amount of pool is no longer equal to the number of Methusalah, but is stable at 3.
    The card is then less powerful in the game beginning, but is still a good fit in this deck.
