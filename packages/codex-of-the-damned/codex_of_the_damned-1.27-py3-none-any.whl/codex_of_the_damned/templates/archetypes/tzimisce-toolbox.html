<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using the Tzimisce
    and their {{ VIC }}{{ AUS }}{{ ANI }} disciplines.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module uses {{ chiropteran_marauder }} for aggravated damage,
    Intercept is high with 27 reactions combining {{ AUS }} and {{ ANI }}.
    Political actions are used to deliver pool damage with {{ kine_resources_contested }}
    while {{ changeling }} and {{ mind_of_the_wilds }} are used for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    {{ blood_doll }} and {{ villein }} are used to get some pool back.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is a bit slow but very difficult to predict for opponents.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    This version of the deck includes <em>a lot</em> of cards in only 1 copy.
    This is a bit rare, but it makes the deck even harder to figure out for opponents.
    One should be careful to keep the opponents guessing as to what the deck can really do.
</p>
<p>
    {{ under_siege }} is a powerful deterrent against the predator:
    knowing wakes are available is far more troublesome than suspecting one has it in had.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There is a lot of room for variations, including in the crypt:
    {{ sascha_vykos_the_angel_of_caine }}, {{ stravinsky }} or {{ meshenka }}
    can get a star position with 3 copies.
</p>
<p>
    A bit more permanent intercept is a common inclusion, with
    {{ bowl_of_convergence }}, {{ revenant }} and {{ mr_winthrop }}.
    Permanent bleed enhancement is often included too, be it with
    {{ pulse_of_the_canaille }}, {{ j_s_simmons_esq }} and {{ tasha_morgan }},
    or {{ living_manse }}.
