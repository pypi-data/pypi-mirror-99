<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using
    {{ reunion_kamut }} and {{ recruitment_exercise }} to get more vampires out fast and cheap.
    Bleed is done using {{ loss }}, with {{ obf }} modifiers for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    Black Hand Seraphs have acces to the {{ a_b }} enhancers {{ tattoo_signal }} and
    {{ seraphs_second }}, allowing the same vampire to run both bloat and bleed actions in a single turn.
</p>
<p>
    {{ watchtower_the_wolves_feed }} hits the table at some point to improve bleed power,
    after an innocuous Gehenna card like {{ break_the_code }} has been played.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ the_art_of_memory }} is a versatile modifier and provides a bit of recursion.
    It can be used to get a {{ loss }}, {{ seraphs_second }} or {{ reunion_kamut }} back,
    depending on the hand.
</p>
<p>
    {{ blood_awakening }} can be used to improve stealth or to intercept a key action,
    depending on the context.
</p>
<p>
    The deck should avoid combat until {{ watchtower_the_wolves_feed }} hits the table,
    as it has nothing else to help combat.
</p>
<p>
    {{ the_fourth_cycle }} is used as a last resort safety line to avoid dying from
    {{ watchtower_the_wolves_feed }} if too many Gehenna cards hit the table.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The Assamite version as given in example is the most common.
    {{ truth_in_ink }} can be added along some wakes for bleed defence
    and {{ no_trace }} for combat ends.
</p>
<p>
    A common variation uses a mid capacity multi-clan Black Hand crypt with {{ dom }}.
    It looses the {{ obf }} stealth but can be more toolboxy and even include a decent combat module.
    {{ mark_loughmans_deck }} from 2018 is a recent example.
</p>
<p>
    {{ elimelech_the_twice_damned }} can be the star of a similar construct using
    {{ AUS }} and even {{ DEM }} atop {{ obf }}. It looses the access to {{ loss }}
    but gets bounces with {{ AUS }} and can even get {{ kindred_spirits }} if {{ DEM }}
    is present enough in the crypt. {{ carlo_danieles_deck }} from 2019 is a recent example.
