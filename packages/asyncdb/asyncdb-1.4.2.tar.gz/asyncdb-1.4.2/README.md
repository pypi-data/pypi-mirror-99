# AsyncDB #

AsyncDB is a collection of different Database Drivers using asyncio-based connections, binary-connectors (as asyncpg) but providing an abstraction layer to easily connect to different data sources.

### Why AsyncDB? ###

The finality of AsyncDB is to provide us a subset of drivers (connectors) for accessing different databases and data sources for data interaction.
The main goal of AsyncDB is using asyncio-based technologies.

### Quick Tutorial ###

Currently AsyncDB supports the following databases:

* PostgreSQL (requires asyncpg and aiopg)
* SQLite (requires aiosqlite)
* mySQL (requires aiomysql)
* SQLAlchemy (requires sqlalchemy_aio)
* RethinkDB (requires rethinkdb)
* Redis (requires aioredis)

#### Future work: ####
* MS SQL Server (non-asyncio using freeTDS or using aiodbc)
* Apache Cassandra
* CouchBase
* InfluxDB
* Prometheus
