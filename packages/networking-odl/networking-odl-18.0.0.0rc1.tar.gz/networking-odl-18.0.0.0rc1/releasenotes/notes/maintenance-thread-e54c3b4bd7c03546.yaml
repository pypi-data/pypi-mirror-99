    Maintenance thread for the V2 driver.
features:
  - The maintenance thread was introduced in the V2 driver
    in order to perform various journal maintenance tasks,
    such as

    * Stale lock release
    * Completed entry cleanup
    * Full sync
    * Journal recovery

    The thread runs in a configurable interval and is HA
    safe so at most one will be executing regardless of how
    many threads are running concurrently.
upgrade:
  - Maintenace lock table was added to synchronize multiple
    threads.
