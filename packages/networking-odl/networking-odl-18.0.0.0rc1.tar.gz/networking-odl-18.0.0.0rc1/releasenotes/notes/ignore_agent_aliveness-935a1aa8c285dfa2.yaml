    Agent aliveness will be ignored during port binding.

    During scale tests we saw that neutron agent aliveness mechanism is not
    working properly and was marking agents as down and thus failing on port
    binding. We assessed that aliveness in our context is not actually
    interesting, as we only use the agentdb mechanism to store the information
    we need for port binding.

    As a result of this assessment we decided to remove the aliveness
    awareness from the code and try to bind the port disregarding that. The
    consequence of this is that a "neutron agent-list" call might show the
    agent as dead or alive but that's not information we should depend on to
    understand if we are binding to that node.
