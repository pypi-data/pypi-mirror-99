    The config option odl_features_json has been added to allow specifying
    features in the same format ODL returns during negotiation.
features:
  - |
    The odl_features_json option accepts a JSON compatible with the JSON
    response from ODL's API for retrieving features
    ("/restconf/operational/neutron:neutron/features").

    If this option is configured, networking_odl will not query ODL for
    its feature support and will instead use the configured value. If
    odl_features and odl_features_json are both specified, odl_features_json
    will take precedence and odl_features will not be used at all.
