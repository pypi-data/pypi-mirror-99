prelude: >
    Support for vlan-transparency.
features:
  - The extension `vlan-transparent` is supported for Newton
    release, unconditionally only vxlan is considered to
    support its extension independent of ODL openstack
    provider. It's future work to allow ODL openstack
    provider to report list of supported network types
    at start up statically.
issues:
  - Currently only network type of VXLAN is statically
    considered to support vlan-transparent independently
    of OpenDaylight openstack provider.
    It should use capability report by OpenDaylight
    openstack provider statically instead of static hard
    code.
other:
  - For details please read

    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/kilo/nfv-vlan-trunks.html>'_.
