    OpenDaylight feature negotiation allows for networking_odl to adapt its
    behavior to the features supported by the specific ODL version.
features:
  - Networking-odl first attempts to read the ODL features from the
    odl_features config value. If this config value is not present,
    networking-odl requests the features from ODL via REST call. Note that this
    occurs during the plugin initialize and if ODL is unreachable
    networking-odl will keep trying until successful, essentially blocking
    networking-odl initialization (and functionality) until successful.
    As such, it is recommended that in production environments you manually
    configure the odl_features config value. If you are not sure which features
    your ODL supports, please consult the ODL documentation or you can retrieve
    the list like this,
    $ curl -u <user>:<pass> http://<host>:8080/restconf/operational/neutron:neutron/features | python -mjson.tool
    Note that the features returned in the json have a namespace which should
    be omitted from the config value. So, if you got to features, say
    neutron-extensions:feature1 and neutron-extensions:feature2, the config
    file should have,
    odl_features=feature1,feature2
