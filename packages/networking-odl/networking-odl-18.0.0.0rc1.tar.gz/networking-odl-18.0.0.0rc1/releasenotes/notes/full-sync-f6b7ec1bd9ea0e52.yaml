    Full sync supports and ODL controller with no Neutron
    resources on it.
    This support is for the V2 driver, as V1 driver already
    supports this.
features:
  - The full sync process looks for a "canary" network on
    the ODL controller side.
    If such a network is found, it doesn't do anything.
    If the network is missing then all the neutron
    resources are re-created on ODL.
    This supports cases when ODL controller comes online
    with no Neutron resources on it (also referred to as
    "cold reboot", but can happen on various cases).
