    update the default value of supported network
    type for ovs-set-hostconfig. enable 'flat' by default
    'flat' type wasn't enabled because legacy netvirt
    doesn't support it. Now new netvirt is introduced
    to deprecate legacy netvirt and New netvirt supports
    flat. So update default value for network type
    to reflect it.
upgrade:
  - If you're still using legacy netvirt, you need to
    disable flat network type explicitly when issuing
    set-ovs-hostconfig command.
