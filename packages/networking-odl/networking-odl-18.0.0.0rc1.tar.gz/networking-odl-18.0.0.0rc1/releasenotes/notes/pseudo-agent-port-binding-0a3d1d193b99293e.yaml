    Agentless Port binding controller using agentdb
    for persistency with ODL provided host configuration.
features:
  - Reads host configuration from ODL using a REST/get
    and stores the information in Neutron agentdb for
    persistency. This host configuration is read back
    from agentdb and applied during port binding.
    Without this feature several out-of-sync race
    conditions were caused due to incorrect host
    information.
fixes:
  - Includes the following bug fixes
    Bug 1608659 - pseudo_agentdb_binding AttributeError.
