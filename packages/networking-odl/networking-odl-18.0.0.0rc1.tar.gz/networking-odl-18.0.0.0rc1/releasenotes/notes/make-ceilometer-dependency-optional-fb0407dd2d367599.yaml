    Ceilometer becomes an optional dependency
features:
  - |
    If a user wants to utilize the ceilometer driver when installing
    networking-odl, the user should install networking-odl with the following
    syntax ==> networking-odl[ceilometer]
    In case, that driver is not needed, then only networking-odl should be
    used
    This makes sense because ceilometer driver is only loaded when neutron
    cfg requires network.statistics.driver and not by default
