prelude: >
    Change the default value of port_binding_controller
    from network-topology to pseudo-agentdb-binding
    as networking-topology will be deprecated.
upgrade:
  - pseudo-agentdb-binding is supported by the version
    of OpenDaylight Boron(0.5.x) or later.
    So for the version of OpenDaylight Beryllium or earlier,
    the option, port_binding_controller, needs to be
    explicitly configured to be legacy-port-binding or
    network-topology(deprecated).
deprecations:
  - port binding controller, network-topology, is
    deprecated with OpenStack Ocata and will be removed
    in future openstack version.
