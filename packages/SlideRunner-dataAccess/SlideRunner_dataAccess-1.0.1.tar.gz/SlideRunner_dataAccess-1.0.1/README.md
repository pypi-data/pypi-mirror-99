## SlideRunner dataAccess ##

This is the dataaccess auxilliary package for SlideRunner, an open source microscopy (and, actually, many other image formats) annotation tool.

Since the SlideRunner database format and the slide wrapper are used in other packages as well, we split it up.

Requirements:
- openslide-python>=1.1.1
- opencv-python>=3.1.0
- nibabel>=3.1.1
- matplotlib>=2.0.0
- numpy>=1.13
- pydicom>=2.1.2
