        # lbt-dragonfly
        
        Collection of all Dragonfly core Python libraries.
        
        Note that this repository and corresponding Python package does not contain any
        code and it simply exists to provide a shortcut for installing all of the dragonfly
        core libraries together.
        
        ## Included Dragonfly Extensions
        
        Running `pip install lbt-dragonfly` will result in the installation of the following
        dragonfly Python packages:
        
        * [dragonfly-uwg](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/dragonfly-uwg)
        * [dragonfly-energy](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/dragonfly-energy)
        
        ## Included Dragonfly Core Libraries
        
        Since both dragonfly extensions use the dragonfly core libraries, the following
        dependencies are also included:
        
        * [dragonfly-core](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/dragonfly-core)
        * [dragonfly-schema](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/dragonfly-schema)
        
        ## All Ladybug and Honeybee Packages Are Also Included
        
        Since dragonfly uses ladybug and honeybee, the following dependencies are also included:
        
        * [lbt-ladybug](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-ladybug)
        * [lbt-honeybee](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-honeybee)
