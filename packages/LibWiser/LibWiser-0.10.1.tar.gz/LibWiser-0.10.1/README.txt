WISEr: Wavefront Simulation Software Reloaded. The Library 

WISEr is a physical optics package, currently based on Huygens-Fresnel propagation integral, conceived for simulating the optical performances of X-Ray Mirrors. 
At a glance:
- It operates with 1d optical elements, with monochromatic 
- Supports 1d Optical Elements
- Elliptical, spherical mirrors, Gaussian and spherical sources, slits, etc..
- Figure error and Roughness
- Automated "Task" Routines for investigating mirror performances (Best focus, wavelength sweep, source angular sweep, source longitudinal sweep)  

Upcoming
- Partially coherent light
- Numerical sources
