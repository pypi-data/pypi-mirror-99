Description: # pyTSI
        
        pyTSI is a read-only Python SDK for Microsoft Azure time series insights. 
        It provides methods to conveniently retrieve your data and is designed
        for analysts, data scientists and developers working with time series 
        data in Azure TSI.
        
        The main objective of this library are to:
        * Not transform the data in any way. The information will be provided
          to you as delivered by the TSI, gaps and all. The only exception to
          this is that when requesting time series you can ask for rows comprised
          entirely on NaN's to be removed.
        * Make it easy and pythonic to obtain the information in the TSI as a
          pandas DataFrame.
        
        Please note that the code is under heavy development and the API will
        change frequently and the documentation is not (yet) updated. Also, 
        please note that even though this code started as a fork of 
        [TSClient](https://github.com/RaaLabs/TSIClient), pyTSI is not compatible
        at all with TSIClient.
        
        ## Documentation
        - Azure time series REST APIs: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/time-series-insights/>
        
        ## Quickstart
        Instantiate the TSIClient to query your TSI environment. Use the credentials 
        from your service principal in Azure that has access to the TSI environment 
        (you can also use environment variables to instantiate the pyTSI or provide 
        a specific TSI API version, check the documentation).
        
        ```python
        from pyTSI import TSIClient as TSI
        
        client = TSI.TSIClient(environment_name='<your-tsi-env-name>',
                               client_id='<your-client-id>',
                               client_secret='<your-client-secret>',
                               tenant_id='<your-tenant-id>',
                               application_name='<your-app-name>')
        
        # List the instances in the TSI, also list their types
        # and variables.
        for instance in client.time_series():
            print(f'\t{instance}')
            print('\tInstance type description:')
            print(f'\t\t{instance.series_type}')
            print('\t\tType vars:')
            for v in instance.series_type.vars:
                print(f'\t\t\t{v}')
        ```
        
        You can now query each instance
        
        You can query your timeseries data by timeseries id, timeseries name or timeseries 
        description. The Microsoft TSI apis support aggregation, so you can specify a 
        sampling freqency and an aggregation method. Refer to the documentation for detailed 
        information.
        
        ```python
        import datetime
        
        # Define the start & end times for the series that we want to retrieve
        t0 = datetime.datetime(year=2020, month=10, day=22, hour=10, minute=53, second=00,
                               tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
        t1 = datetime.datetime(year=2020, month=10, day=22, hour=11, minute=53, second=30,
                               tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)
        
        # Select a time series by selecting from the list of by filtering by ID
        ts = client.time_series.get_by_id(['Time series ID'])
        t = ts.series_type
        # Get raw event data
        raw_events = ts.get_events(start=t0, end=t1, 
                                   variables=[t.temperature, t.humidity],
                                   drop_nans=True)
        # Get series data for raw events & composed variables
        series_data = ts.get_series(start=t0, end=t1, 
                                    variables=[t.temperature, t.humidity, t.series_sum],
                                    drop_nans=True)
        # Aggregate series
        aggregated_data = ts.aggregate_series(start=t0, end=t1, interval='PT1M', 
                                              variables=[t.temperature, t.EventCount],
                                              drop_nans=True)
        ```
        
        Each of these functions return a DataFrame, with variable names as columns.
