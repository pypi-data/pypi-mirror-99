features:
  - |
    An "Admin/Rating Summary" tab has been added. An admin user can now have
    the cost of every rated tenant at once. By clicking on a tenant, a
    per-resource total for the given tenant can be obtained (this view is
    similar to the "Project/Rating" tab). A per-resource total for the whole
    cloud is also available.

upgrade:
  - |
    The "Project/Rating" tab has been improved: it does now provide a total
    by metric type. This make use of the /summary endpoint instead of /total
    (/total is deprecated).
