# Hivemind utility functions

These functions provide lightweight wrappers around the Hivemind API calls.

They handle construction of HTTP requests, pagination of results, and the pairing up of output data with corresponding input data. Apart from that they do nothing complicated at all, and can be used as a template for constructing your own more complicated API calls.
