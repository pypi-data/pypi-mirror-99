[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/coldfront/badge/?version=latest)](https://coldfront.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

ColdFront is an open source resource allocation system designed to provide a
central portal for administration, reporting, and measuring scientific impact
of HPC resources. ColdFront was created to help HPC centers manage access to a
diverse set of resources across large groups of users and provide a rich set of
extensible meta data for comprehensive reporting. ColdFront is written in
Python and released under the GPLv3 license.

## Features

- Allocation based system for managing access to resources
- Collect Project, Grant, and Publication data from users
- Define custom attributes on resources and allocations
- Email notifications for expiring/renewing access to resources
- Integration with 3rd party systems for automation and access control
