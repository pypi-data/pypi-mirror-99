Description: 
        An INDI Client Python API, auto-generated from the official C++ API using SWIG.
        
        Installation
        
        Use pip (recommended): pip install pyindi-client
        
        Alternatively download a release, extract it and run: python setup.py install
        
        The file setup.cfg contains configuration options (mainly concerning libindi installation path).
        The file setup.py searchs for the libindiclient.a library in some predefined directories.
        If not found, the script fails. Locate this library (try locate lindiclient.a from the command line)
        and add its path to the libindisearchpaths variable in the setup script.
        
        Dependencies
        
        For the above installation to work, you need to have installed from your distribution repositories the following packages: Python setup tools, Python development files, libindi development files and swig.
        - On an Ubuntu-like distribution, you may use:
        apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev libindi-dev swig
        - On a Fedora-like distribution, you may use (dnf or yum):
        dnf install python-setuptools python-devel libindi-devel swig
