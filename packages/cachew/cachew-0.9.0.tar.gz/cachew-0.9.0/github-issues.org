:END:
: At the moment there are two separate tables: one for latest hash value, another for cached entities.
: It might be simpler and safer to keep a single table, with hash along with each cached entity.
: 
** OPEN support multiple cached values?

: At the moment it's LRU(1) cache, it some usecases it makes sense to cache more values though
:

:END:
: Path is a trivial wrapper around str. I guess generally think of a good way to allow adhoc mapping of simple types.
: Perhaps current Exception makes sense.

: E.g. if we can't serialize for some reason, bail the database but at least yield values anyway

: Add Redis support as an alternative to sqlite
: 
: This would be a great feature as it will make this solution easier to use in an enterprise production environment as getting a redis instance shared amonst multiple instances of your app is very easy and cost effective to use.
