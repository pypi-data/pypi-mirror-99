Description: # conda-lock
        
        Conda lock is a lightweight library that can be used to generate fully reproducible lock files for [conda][conda]
        environments.
        
        It does this by performing a conda solve for each platform you desire a lockfile for.
        
        This also has the added benefit of acting as an external pre-solve for conda as the lockfiles it generates
        results in the conda solver *not* being invoked when installing the packages from the generated lockfile.
        
        ## why?
        
        Conda [`environment.yml`][envyaml] files are very useful for defining desired environments but there are times when we want to
        be able to EXACTLY reproduce an environment by just installing and downloading the packages needed.
        
        This is particularly handy in the context of a gitops style setup where you use conda to provision environments in
        various places.
        
        ## installation
        
        ```
        pip install conda-lock
        conda install conda-lock
        ```
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        ```bash
        # generate the lockfiles
        conda-lock -f environment.yml -p osx-64 -p linux-64
        
        # create an environment from the lockfile
        conda-lock install [-p {prefix}|-n {name}] conda-linux-64.lock
        
        # alternatively, use conda command directly
        conda create -n my-locked-env --file conda-linux-64.lock
        ```
        
        ## Advance usage
        
        #### File naming
        
        By default conda-lock will name files as `"conda-{platform}.lock"`.
        
        If you want to override that call conda-lock as follows.
        ```bash
        conda-lock --filename-template "specific-{platform}.conda.lock"
        ```
        
        #### Compound specification
        
        Conda-lock will build a spec list from several files if requested.
        
        ```bash
        conda-lock -f base.yml -f specific.yml -p linux-64 --filename-format "specific-{platform}.lock"
        ````
        
        In this case all dependencies are combined, and the first non-empty value for `channels` is used as the final
        specification.
        
        This works for all supported file types.
        
        #### channel overrides
        
        You can override the channels that are used by conda-lock in case you need to override the ones specified in
        an [environment.yml][envyaml]
        
        ```bash
        conda-lock -c conda-forge -p linux-64
        ```
        
        #### --dev-dependencies/--no-dev-dependencies
        
        By default conda-lock will include dev dependencies in the specification of the lock (if the files that the lock
        is being built from support them).  This can be disabled easily
        
        ```bash
        conda-lock --no-dev-dependencies -f ./recipe/meta.yaml
        ```
        
        #### --strip-auth, --auth and --auth-file
        
        By default `conda-lock` will leave basic auth credentials for private conda channels in the lock file. If you wish to strip authentication from the file, provide the `--strip-auth` argument.
        
        ```
        conda-lock --strip-auth -f environment.yml
        ```
        
        In order to `conda-lock install` a lock file with its basic auth credentials stripped, you will need to create an authentication file in `.json` format like this:
        
        ```json
        {
          "domain": "username:password",
          // ...
        }
        ```
        
        You can provide the authentication either as string through `--auth` or as a filepath through `--auth-file`.
        
        ```
        conda-lock install --auth-file auth.json conda-linux-64.lock
        ```
        
        ## Supported file sources
        
        Conda lock supports more than just [environment.yml][envyaml] specifications!
        
        Additionally conda-lock supports [meta.yaml][metayaml] (conda-build)
        and `pyproject.toml` (
        [flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
        based).  These do come with some gotchas but are generally good enough for the 90% use-case.
        
        ### meta.yaml
        
        Conda-lock will attempt to make an educated guess at the desired environment spec in a meta.yaml.  This is
        not guaranteed to work for complex recipes with many selectors and outputs.  For multi-output recipes, conda-lock
        will fuse all the dependencies together.  If that doesn't work for your case fall back to specifying the specification
        as an [environment.yml][envyaml]
        
        Since a meta.yaml doesn't contain channel information we make use of the following extra key to retrieve channels
        
        ```yaml
        # meta.yaml
        
        extra:
          channels:
            - conda-forge
            - defaults
        ```
        
        ### pyproject.toml configuration
        
        Since pyproject.toml files are commonly used by python packages it can be desirable to create a lock
        file directly from those dependencies to single-source a package's dependencies.  This makes use of some
        conda-forge infrastructure ([pypi-mapping][mapping]) to do a lookup of the PyPI package name to a corresponding
        conda package name (e.g. `docker` -> `docker-py`).  In cases where there exists no lookup for the package it assumes that
        the PyPI name, and the conda name are the same.
        
        #### channels
        
        ```toml
        # pyproject.toml
        
        [tool.conda-lock]
        channels = [
            'conda-forge', 'defaults'
        ]
        ```
        
        #### extra dependencies
        
        Since in a `pyproject.toml` all the definitions are python dependencies if you need
        to specify some non-python dependencies as well this can be accomplished by adding
        the following sections to the `pyproject.toml`
        
        ```toml
        # pyproject.toml
        
        [tool.conda-lock.dependencies]
        sqlite = ">=3.34"
        ```
        
        
        ## Dockerfile example
        
        In order to use conda-lock in a docker-style context you want to add the lockfile to the
        docker container.  In order to refresh the lock file just run `conda-lock` again.
        
        Given aa file tree like
        ```
          Dockerfile
          environment.yaml
        * conda-linux-64.lock
        ```
        
        You want a dockerfile that is structured something similar to this
        
        ```Dockerfile
        # Dockerfile
        
        # Build container
        FROM continuumio/miniconda:latest as conda
        
        ADD conda-linux-64.lock /locks/conda-linux-64.lock
        RUN conda create -p /opt/env --copy --file /locks/conda-linux-64.lock
        
        # Primary container
        
        FROM gcr.io/distroless/base-debian10
        
        COPY --from=conda /opt/env /opt/env
        ```
