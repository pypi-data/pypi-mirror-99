# python-challenge-bypass-ristretto

Python bindings for Brave's [privacy pass](https://github.com/brave-intl/challenge-bypass-ristretto) library
using the provided [ffi](https://github.com/brave-intl/challenge-bypass-ristretto-ffi) APIs.

# Usage

The API largely mirrors that of the underlying Rust library with a few classes thrown in.
For example:

```
>>> from challenge_bypass_ristretto import  RandomToken
>>> print(RandomToken.create().blind().encode_base64())

```

# How to install

Binary wheels for Linux (manylinux2010), macOS, and Windows are distributed on PyPI.

```
pip install python-challenge-bypass-ristretto
```

# How to build

The Rust FFI library is a git submodule, so to clone all sources needed for a build:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LeastAuthority/python-challenge-bypass-ristretto
```

Then, with the Rust and Python toolchains installed:

```
python setup.py build sdist bdist_wheel
pip install --editable .
```

There is also Nix-based package which manages most of this complexity for you and only requires a checkout:

```
nix-build
```
