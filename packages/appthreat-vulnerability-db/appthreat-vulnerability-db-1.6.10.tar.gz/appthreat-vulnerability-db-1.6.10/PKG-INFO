Description: # Introduction
        
        This repo is a vulnerability database and package search for sources such as NVD, GitHub and so on. It uses a built-in file based storage to allow offline access.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install appthreat-vulnerability-db
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        This package is ideal as a library for managing vulnerabilities. This is used by [dep-scan](http://github.com/AppThreat/dep-scan), a free open-source dependency audit tool. However, there is a limited cli capability available with few features to test this tool directly.
        
        ### Cache vulnerability data
        
        ```bash
        vdb --cache
        ```
        
        It is possible to customise the cache behaviour by increasing the historic data period to cache by setting the following environment variables.
        
        - NVD_START_YEAR - Default: 2016. Supports upto 2002
        - GITHUB_PAGE_COUNT - Default: 5. Supports upto 20
        
        ### Periodic sync
        
        To periodically sync the latest vulnerabilities and update the database cache.
        
        ```bash
        vdb --sync
        ```
        
        ### Basic search
        
        It is possible to perform simple search using the cli.
        
        ```bash
        vdb --search android:8.0
        
        vdb --search google:android:8.0
        
        vdb --search android:8.0,simplesamlphp:1.14.11
        ```
        
        Syntax is package:version,package:version or vendor : package : version (Without space)
