# Torchsort

Pure PyTorch implementation of [Fast Differentiable Sorting and
Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08871) (Blondel et al.). Much of the code is
copied from the original Numpy implementation at
[google-research/fast-soft-sort](https://github.com/google-research/fast-soft-sort),
with the Isotonic regression solver rewritten as a PyTorch C++ Extension.
