Usage: 
  debug [options]
options:
  -p, --print-only         just provides the URL, doesn't attempt to launch
  			   browser

'debug' makes it possible to locally test your experiment without contacting
Mechanical Turk servers. Type 'debug' to launch your experiment in a browser
window, or use the '--print-only' flag to create a URL to the experiment
without launching a browser. The server must be running to debug your
experiment (try 'server on').
