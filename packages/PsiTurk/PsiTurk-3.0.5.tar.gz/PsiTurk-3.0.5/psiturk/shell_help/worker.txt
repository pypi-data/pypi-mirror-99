'worker' is used with the following subcommands:
  approve   Approve worker assignments for one or more assignment ID's, or
  	    use the '--hit' flag to approve all workers for a specific HIT.
  reject    Reject worker assignments for one or more assignment ID's, or use
            the '--hit' flag to reject all workers for a specific HIT.
  unreject  Unreject worker assignments for one or more assignment ID's, or use
            the '--hit' flag to unreject all rejected workers for a specific HIT.
  bonus     Grant bonuses to workers for one or more assignment ID's, or use
            the '--hit' flag to bonus all workers for a specific HIT. Enter the
            bonus '--amount <amount>' in an X.XX format, or use the '--auto' flag
            to bonus each worker according to the 'bonus' field in the database
            (requires a custom bonus route in the experiment's custom.py file).
            Bonuses given using the '--hit' flag will only be applied to
            workers who have not already been bonused for the HIT, but bonuses
            given to specific assignment ID's will be given regardless of
            whether the worker has already been bonused.
  list      List all workers, or list workers fitting a specific status using.
            the provided flags.  Use the '--hit' flag to list workers for a
            specific HIT.
