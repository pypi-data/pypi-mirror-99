A file named "start_bot.py" has been created in the current folder:
it contains the minimal code needed to run the bot. It will be running
unless it crashes or is manually killed.

The bot execution is quiet, except at startup and if an exception
occurs, so we advise you to log the output stream somewhere!
We also advise you to use an external script to ensure the bot has
not crashed -- pretty unlikely, but it might always happen; see also
"output_liveness" customization option in the docs:
https://lg-rez.readthedocs.io/fr/2.0.0/config.html#lgrez.config.output_liveness

You can no try to interact with the bot!
(For your first tests, note that the bot ignore every messages posted by
a member without any role! Assign yourself the "MJ" role to get full
rights with the bot.)

Do not hesitate to reach us for any issue or suggestion, we're always
happy to get news. See bottom of README for contacts.

Enjoy!""")
