Description: # socatlord
        
        socatlord is a tool to manage multiple socats
        
        You feed it with a config file placed at
        `/etc/socatlord` that has the syntax like:
        
        ```
        # this is a comment
        
        9.9.9.9:80 -> 123.23.4.3.:81
        80 -> 192.168.224.20:80
        udp 0.0.0.0:23 -> 192.168.224.20:23
        ```
        
        TCP is the default protocol.
        Socatlord will spawn as many socats as necessary.
        
        # Usage
        
        After you put this file, call `socatlord install`. This will install and enable socatlord to start
        during your startups (only if you're using Systemd).
        `/etc/socatlord` will be created about then.
        
        Later call `socatlord run` to terminate currently running socats and launch your own.
        This may terminate your SSH connection, if you're using a socat to proxy it though.
        
        You can also call `socatlord stop` to stop all socats.
        
        You can provide an optional argument of `-v` to see what commands are launched
