        #   This is a Windows-specific function, and it is assuming the extensions use the Universal CRT
        #   (Visual C++ Runtime for Visual Studio 2015 and later), not considering older CRT versions, and not
        #   doing any extra effort to make sure CRT environment used by Python itself gets the updated value.
        # Details:
        #   Modifications done via Python os.environ['name'] updates an internal Python dictionary, as well as
        #   Windows API environment. When a Python C extension library (.pyd) is imported, the dependent
        #   C Run-Time (CRT) library will be loaded with a copy of environment from Windows API. Later changes to
        #   the environment in Python and Windows API will not be reflected in the CRT copy, and therefore not seen
        #   by the extension. Since (normally) only the first extension will load the shared CRT library, with a
        #   copy of environment variables at that point in time, any additional Python extensions imported later on
        #   will also just see the same environment as the first. This function updates the environment within the
        #   currently loaded CRT library with the value currently in Python's os.environ (the value will also be
        #   written back to the Windows API, but assuming os.environ is synchronized the value should already be there).
