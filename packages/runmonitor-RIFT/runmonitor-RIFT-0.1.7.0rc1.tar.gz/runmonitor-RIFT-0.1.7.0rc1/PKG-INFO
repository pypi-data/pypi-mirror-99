Description: # RIFT run-monitor
        
        A package providing utilities for monitoring and healing runs with [RIFT](https://pypi.org/project/RIFT/). Built from https://git.ligo.org/richard.udall/runmonitor_rift, with original work done at https://git.ligo.org/richard.udall/miscelleaneous-scripts/
        
        Developed by Adhav Arulanandan, Grihith Manchanda, Richard O'Shaughnessy, and Richard Udall
        
        ## Installation
        This package assumes the user is on an LDAS-like cluster.
        
        To install, do the standard: pip install runmonitor\_rift
        
        Configure environment variables:
        * RUNMON\_BASE = a sub-directory in a public-facing directory (e.g. ~/public\_html/RUNMON/)
        * RUNMON\_CLUSTER = a designator for a cluster (e.g. CIT)
        
        Some functionality, especially for healing scripts, will work best if this is installed in an environment which also has RIFT installed, though overrides will usually be available.
