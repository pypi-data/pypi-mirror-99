pycstruct is a python library for converting binary data to and from ordinary
python dictionaries or specific instance objects.

Data is defined similar to what is done in C language structs, unions,
bitfields and enums.

Typical usage of this library is read/write binary files or binary data
transmitted over a network.

Following complex C types are supported:

- Structs
- Unions
- Bitfields
- Enums

These types may consist of any traditional data types (integer, unsigned integer, 
boolean and float) between 1 to 8 bytes large, arrays (lists), and strings (ASCII/UTF-8).

Structs, unions, bitfields and enums can be embedded inside other structs/unions
in any level. 

Individual elements can be stored / read in any byte order and alignment.

pycstruct also supports parsing of existing C language source code to
automatically generate the pycstruct definitions / instances.

## Installation

Simply install the package using pip:

    python3 -m pip install pycstruct

## Example

Following C has a structure (person) with a set of elements
that are written to a binary file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>

#pragma pack(1) // To secure no padding is added in struct

struct person 
{ 
    char name[50];
    unsigned int age;
    float height;
    bool is_male;
    unsigned int nbr_of_children;
    unsigned int child_ages[10];
};


void main(void) {
    struct person p;
    memset(&p, 0, sizeof(struct person));

    strcpy(p.name, "Foo Bar");
    p.age = 42;
    p.height = 1.75; // m
    p.is_male = true;
    p.nbr_of_children = 2;
    p.child_ages[0] = 7;
    p.child_ages[1] = 9;

    FILE *f = fopen("simple_example.dat", "w");
    fwrite(&p, sizeof(struct person), 1, f);
    fclose(f);
}
```

To read the binary file using pycstruct following code 
required.

```python
import pycstruct

person = pycstruct.StructDef()
person.add('utf-8', 'name', length=50)
person.add('uint32', 'age')
person.add('float32','height')
person.add('bool8', 'is_male')
person.add('uint32', 'nbr_of_children')
person.add('uint32', 'child_ages', length=10)

with open('simple_example.dat', 'rb') as f:
    inbytes = f.read()

# Dictionary representation
result = person.deserialize(inbytes)
print('Dictionary object:')
print(str(result))

# Alternative, Instance representation
instance = person.instance(inbytes)
print('\nInstance object:')
print('name: {}'.format(instance.name))
print('nbr_of_children: {}'.format(instance.nbr_of_children))
print('child_ages[1]: {}'.format(instance.child_ages[1]))
```

The produced output will be::

    {'name': 'Foo Bar', 'is_male': True, 'nbr_of_children': 2, 
     'age': 42, 'child_ages': [7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
     'height': 1.75}

    Instance object:
    name: Foo Bar
    nbr_of_children: 2
    child_ages[1]: 9

To write a binary file from python using the same structure
using pycstruct following code is required.

```python
import pycstruct

person = pycstruct.StructDef()
person.add('utf-8', 'name', length=50)
person.add('uint32', 'age')
person.add('float32','height')
person.add('bool8', 'is_male')
person.add('uint32', 'nbr_of_children')
person.add('uint32', 'child_ages', length=10)

# Dictionary representation
mrGreen = {}
mrGreen['name'] = "MR Green"
mrGreen['age'] = 50
mrGreen['height'] = 1.93
mrGreen['is_male'] = True
mrGreen['nbr_of_children'] = 3
mrGreen['child_ages'] = [13,24,12]
buffer = person.serialize(mrGreen)

# Alternative, Instance representation
mrGreen = person.instance()
mrGreen.name = "MR Green"
mrGreen.age = 50
mrGreen.height = 1.93
mrGreen.is_male = True
mrGreen.nbr_of_children = 3
mrGreen.child_ages[0] = 13
mrGreen.child_ages[1] = 24
mrGreen.child_ages[2] = 12
buffer = bytes(mrGreen)

# Write to file
f = open('simple_example_mr_green.dat','wb')
f.write(buffer)
f.close()
```

## Parsing source files

pycstruct also supports parsing C source code defined in external
files or defined in strings.

Assume the C code listed in the first example is named
simple_example.c. Then you could parse the source
code instead of manually creating the definitions:

```python
import pycstruct

definitions = pycstruct.parse_file('simple_example.c')

with open('simple_example.dat', 'rb') as f:
    inbytes = f.read()

# Dictionary representation
result = definitions['person'].deserialize(inbytes)
print(str(result))

# Alternative, Instance representation
instance = definitions['person'].instance(inbytes)
```

The produced output will be the same as in the first example (the dictionary).
