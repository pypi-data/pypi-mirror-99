    .. remarks::

        Create a Tensorboard instance to consume run history from machine learning experiments that
        output Tensorboard logs including those generated in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Chainer.
        In these scenarios, the Tensorboard instance monitors the ``runs`` specified and downloads log data to
        the ``local_root`` location in real time after starting the instance with the
        :meth:`start` method. For long running processes, such as deep neural network training that could take
        days to complete, the Tensorboard instance will continue to download logs and persist them across
        multiple instantiations. Child runs of specified ``runs`` aren't monitored.

        If a Tensorboard instance is created with no runs specified (an empty list), then the instance
        will work against any logs in ``local_root``.

        Start the Tensorboard instance with the :meth:`start` method. Stop the instance with the
        :meth:`stop` method when you are finished with it. For more information
        about using Tensorboard, see `Visualize experiment runs and metrics with
        Tensorboard <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-tensorboard>`_.

        The following example shows how to create a Tensorboard instance to track run history from a
        Tensorflow experiment.

        .. code-block:: python

            from azureml.tensorboard import Tensorboard

            # The Tensorboard constructor takes an array of runs, so be sure and pass it in as a single-element array here
            tb = Tensorboard([run])

            # If successful, start() returns a string with the URI of the instance.
            tb.start()
