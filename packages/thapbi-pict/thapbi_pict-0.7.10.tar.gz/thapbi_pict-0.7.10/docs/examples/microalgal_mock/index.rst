Microalgal Mock Community 18S
=============================

Here we consider seven mock communities of using six freshwater and six marine
microalgae in a staggered gradient, from:

    Bradley *et al.* (2016) Design and Evaluation of Illumina MiSeq-Compatible,
    18S rRNA Gene-Specific Primers for Improved Characterization of Mixed
    Phototrophic Communities.
    https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01630-16

Two different sets of primers were used targeting the V4 and V8V9 regions
of 18S rRNA (which were sequenced separately), which with the current THAPBI
PICT design requires running the pipeline twice.

The full dataset includes environmental samples too, but a meaningful
examination of these would require building a realistic 18S rRNA database
covering more than just the 12 reference species in the mock community.
