Fungal Mock Community ITS1 & 2
==============================

Here we consider mock communities of 19 fungal sequences (in both equal and
staggered ratios), prepared with various protocols, and negative controls.

This example is based on the two amplicon sequencing libraries from this paper:

    Bakker (2018) A fungal mock community control for amplicon sequencing
    experiments.
    https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12760

Three different sets of primers where used (two targeting ITS1, one for ITS2)
which with the current THAPBI PICT design requires running the pipeline three
times.
