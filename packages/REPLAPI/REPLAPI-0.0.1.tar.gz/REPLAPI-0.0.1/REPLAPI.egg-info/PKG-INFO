        ## About the module
        #### This module is based off of @RayhanADev's [github repository](https://github.com/RayhanADev/REPLAPI.it), it was and looked really amazing, so I decided to make a version of that in Python. (sry for ping ray) So that's what i'm doing now! (btw ray, its replit.com, not repl.it ;))
