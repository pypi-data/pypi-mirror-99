Description: # DPAPIck3
        OVERVIEW
        ========
        DPAPIck3 is a python3 toolkit to provide a platform-independant implementation
        of Microsoft's cryptography subsytem called DPAPI (Data Protection API).
        
        It can be used either as a library or as a standalone tool.
        
        It is also the first open-source tool that allows decryption of DPAPI
        structures in an offline way and, moreover, from another plateform than
        Windows.
        
        REQUIREMENTS
        ------------
        This application has been developped and tested on python 3.9.
        
        pycryptodome is required to provide all the requireds algorithms.
        Furthermore only python-registry for some scripts
        * python-registry
        * pycryptodome
