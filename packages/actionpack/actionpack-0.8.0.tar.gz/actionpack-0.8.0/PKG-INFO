        # Overview
        
        Side effects are annoying.
        Verification of intended outcome is often difficult and can depend on the system's state at runtime.
        Questions like _"Is the file going to be present when data is written?"_ or _"Will that service be available?"_ come to mind.
        Keeping track of external system state is just impractical, but declaring intent and encapsulating its disposition is doable.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```python
        >>> action = ReadBytes('path/to/some/file')
        ...
        >>> actions = [action,
        ...            ReadBytes('path/to/some/other/file'),
        ...            ReadInput('>>> how goes? <<<\n  > '),
        ...            MakeRequest('GET', 'http://google.com'),
        ...            RetryPolicy(MakeRequest('GET', 'http://bad-connectivity.com'),
        ...                        max_retries=2,
        ...                        delay_between_attempts=2)
        ...            WriteBytes('path/to/yet/another/file', b'sup')]
        ...
        >>> procedure = Procedure(*actions, sync=False)
        >>> procedure.execute()
        ```
