Listing BASIC Programs
======================

BASIC programs are stored in a binary format, to view the contents of
a file use the ``list`` command:

.. code-block:: text

    (cbm) list myprogram.prg
    5 INPUT"UPPER OR LOWER";C$:SA=0:IFC$="L"THENSA=7
    10 INPUT"FILENAME";F$
    11 OPEN4,4,SA
    15 OPEN2,8,2,F$+",S,R"
    20 GET#2,A$:IFST<>0THENPRINT#4:CLOSE4:CLOSE2:END
    21 IFA$="Ï€"THENA$=","
    30 PRINT#4,A$;:GOTO20

To convert a text file containing BASIC lines use the ``unlist``
command:

.. code-block:: text

    (cbm) unlist myprogram.txt 0:MYPROGRAM
    Writing myprogram.txt to ImagePath(0:b'MYPROGRAM')

By default the address at which the program will load and run is $1201
(4609). Most BASIC programs are relocatable, if an alternative address
is desired it can be specified using the ``--start`` argument:

.. code-block:: text

    (cbm) unlist --start 0x0401 myprogram.txt 0:MYPROGRAM
