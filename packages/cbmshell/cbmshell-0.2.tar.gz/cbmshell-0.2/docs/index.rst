cbmshell
========

A Python application to manipulate the contents of disk images used by
emulators of Commodore 8-bit microcomputers.

Files can be copied between a disk image and the local filesystem as
well as converted to and from PETSCII.

``cbmshell`` has many of the properties of a UNIX shell, giving both
an interactive environment and the ability to run predefined scripts.
