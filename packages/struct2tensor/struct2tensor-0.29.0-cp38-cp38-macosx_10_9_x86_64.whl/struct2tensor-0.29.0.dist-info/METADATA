## Introduction
struct2tensor is a library for parsing structured data inside of tensorflow.
In particular, it makes it easy to manipulate structured data, e.g., slicing,
flattening, copying substructures, and so on, as part of a TensorFlow model
graph. The notebook in 'examples/prensor_playground.ipynb' provides a few
examples of struct2tensor in action and an introduction to the main
concepts. You can
[run the notebook in your browser](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/struct2tensor/blob/master/examples/prensor_playground.ipynb)
through Google's colab environment, or [download the
file](examples/prensor_playground.ipynb) to run it in your own Jupyter
environment.


There are two main use cases of this repo:

1.  To create a PIP package. The PIP package contains plug-ins (OpKernels) to an
    existing tensorflow installation.
2.  To staticlly link with tensorflow-serving.

As these processes are independent, one can follow either set of directions
below.

## Use a pre-built Linux PIP package.


From a virtual environment, run:

```bash
pip install struct2tensor
```
### Nightly Packages

Struct2Tensor also hosts nightly packages at https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org
on Google Cloud. To install the latest nightly package, please use the following
command:

```bash
pip install -i https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org/simple struct2tensor
```

This will install the nightly packages for the major dependencies of Fairness
Indicators such as TensorFlow Metadata (TFMD).

## Creating a PIP package.

The struct2tensor PIP package is useful for creating models.
It works with tensorflow 2.x.

In order to unify the process, we recommend compiling struct2tensor inside
a docker container.


### Downloading the Code

Go to your home directory.

Download the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/struct2tensor.git
cd ~/struct2tensor
```

### Use docker-compose
Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Use it to build a pip wheel for Python 3.6 with tensorflow version 2:

```bash
docker-compose build manylinux2010
docker-compose run -e PYTHON_VERSION=36 -e TF_VERSION=RELEASED_TF_2 manylinux2010
```

Or build a pip wheel for Python 3.7 with tensorflow version 2 (note that if you
run one of these docker-compose commands after the other, the second will erase
the result from the first):

```bash
docker-compose build manylinux2010
docker-compose run -e PYTHON_VERSION=37 -e TF_VERSION=RELEASED_TF_2 manylinux2010
```

This will create a manylinux package in the ~/struct2tensor/dist directory.



## Creating a static library

In order to construct a static library for tensorflow-serving, we run:

```bash
bazel build -c opt struct2tensor:prensor_kernels_and_ops
```

This can also be linked into another library.

## [TensorFlow Serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving) docker image

struct2tensor needs a couple of custom TensorFlow ops to function. If you train
a model with struct2tensor and wants to serve it with TensorFlow Serving, the
TensorFlow Serving binary needs to link with those custom ops. We have a
pre-built docker image that contains such a binary. The `Dockerfile` is
available at `tools/tf_serving_docker/Dockerfile`. The image is available at
`gcr.io/tfx-oss-public/s2t_tf_serving`.

Please see the `Dockerfile` for details. But in brief, the image exposes port
8500 as the gRPC endpoint and port 8501 as the REST endpoint. You can set
two environment variables `MODEL_BASE_PATH` and `MODEL_NAME` to point it to
your model (either mount it to the container, or put your model on GCS).
It will look for a saved model at
`${MODEL_BASE_PATH}/${MODEL_NAME}/${VERSION_NUMBER}`, where `VERSION_NUMBER`
is an integer.
