    ----------
    tolerance : float
        The tolerance criteria used to check for convergence.
    max_iters : int
        The maximum number of iterations to check before returning failure
        condition.
    print_flag : int, optional
        Print flag (default: 0). Valid options:
        - 0: print nothing
        - 1: print information on norms each time `test()` is invoked
        - 2: print information on norms and number of iterations at end of
             successful test
        - 4: print norms at each step and also the Î”U and R(U) vectors.
        - 5: if test fails to converge after `max_iters`, print an error message
             BUT RETURN A SUCCESSFUL TEST.
    norm_type : int, optional
        Type of norm. 0 = max-norm, 1 = 1-norm, 2 = 2-norm, etc. (default: 2)"""
