        ======
        
        The Mys (/ma…™s/) programming language - an attempt to create a
        statically typed Python-like language that produces fast binaries.
        
        Mys is heavily inspired by Python's syntax and Rust's packaging.
        
        Source code:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           from random.pseudo import random
        
           def main():
               print(random())
        
        Package configuration:
        
        .. code-block:: toml
        
           [package]
           name = "robot"
           version = "0.1.0"
           authors = ["Mys Lang <mys.lang@example.com>"]
        
           [dependencies]
           random = "latest"
        
        Mys is mainly targeting resource constrained single core embedded
        systems, but is just as useful in desktop environments.
