üêÅ Mys
======

The Mys (/ma…™s/) programming language - an attempt to create a
statically typed Python-like language that produces fast binaries.

Mys is heavily inspired by Python's syntax and Rust's packaging.

Source code:

.. code-block:: python

   from random.pseudo import random

   def main():
       print(random())

Package configuration:

.. code-block:: toml

   [package]
   name = "robot"
   version = "0.1.0"
   authors = ["Mys Lang <mys.lang@example.com>"]

   [dependencies]
   random = "*"

Mys is mainly targeting resource constrained single core embedded
systems, but is just as useful in desktop environments.
