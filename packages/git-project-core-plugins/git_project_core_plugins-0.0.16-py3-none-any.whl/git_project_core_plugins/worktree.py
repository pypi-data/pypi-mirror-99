    The worktree command manages worktrees and connects them to projects.

    Summary:

      git <project> worktree add [-b <branch>] <name-or-path> [<committish>]
      git <project> worktree rm <name-or-path>
      git <project> worktree config <key> [<value>]
      git <project> worktree config [--unset] <key> [<value>]

    ``worktree add'' creates a new git worktree named via <name-or-path> with
    <committish> checked out.  If we pass -b <branch> we'll get a new branch at
    HEAD or <committish> if it is given.  The worktree name is either the given
    name or if name-or-path is a path, the worktree name will be the same as the
    last path component.  If <name-or-path> is a simple name with no directory
    separators, the worktree will be created as a sub-directory of the current
    directory.

    To keep things simple, we'll usually always name worktrees similarly (or
    identically) to the branches they reference, though it is not strictly
    necessary to do so.

    The key idea behind project worktrees is that they are connected to various
    ``artifacts.''  Worktrees are managed together with this artifacts to
    provide a project-level view of various tasks.  For example, a ``run''
    command can create artifacts associated with a worktree.  Removing the
    worktree implicitly removes thee artifacts, making build cleanups easy and
    convenient.  Commands may use the {worktree} substitution to create
    worktree-unique artifacts.  Other substitutions may also referece {worktree}
    in a recursive manner.

    Here is a concrete example:

      git <project> config srcdir "{path}"
      git <project> config builddir "{srcdir}/build/{worktree}"
      git <project> config make "make -C {srcdir} BUILDDIR={builddir} {build}"
      git <project> run --make-alias build
      git <project> add build release "{make}"

    Assuming the build system uses BUILDDIR to determine where build artifacts
    go, each worktree will get a unique set of build artifacts, via the
    {builddir} and, recursively., {worktree} substitutions.  When we delete the
    worktree, we'll also delete the associoated build directory.

    We associate artifacts with worktrees via the artifact commands.

    Another important benefit of worktrees and associated builds is that
    switching to work on a new worktree (by simply editing sources in a
    different worktree directory) will not result in build artifacts from thte
    previous worktree being overwritten.  Thus we avoid the ``rebuild the
    world'' problems of switching branches within the same workarea.  Generally,
    each created branch will have its own worktree and we will rarely, if ever,
    switch branches within a worktree.

    A worktree layers a config scope on top of the global project scope, so that
    configuring a key in the worktree with the same name as a key in the project
    will cause the worktree key's value to override the project key's value:

      git <project> config buildwidth 16
      git <project> worktree config buildwidth 32

    If we are in a worktree configured with buildwidth=32, then wherever
    {buildwidth} apeears (say, in a run command), the value 32 will be
    substituted instead of 16.  If we are outside the worktree (for example a
    worktree without a buildwidth configured), then {buildwidth} will be
    substituted with 16.
