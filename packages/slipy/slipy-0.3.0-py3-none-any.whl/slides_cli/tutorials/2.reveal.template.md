# Reveal Templates

Following there is a brief description of templates currently available for the
`reveal.js` framework.

## split

This is the **default** template: it is already completely configured, and comes
with a full `head` section and the footer scripts.

It is made such that the user doesn't have to worry about anything of the
surrounding `reveal.js` settings, and just write each slide (or better each
column) on a separate file, keeping everything clean and simple.

It will support basic `html` syntax for slides body, and it expects the
following source structure:

```
<project-root>
  |- src
    |- 0.html
    |- 1.html
    |- 2.html
    |- ...
```

As already said each `\d*.html` file should be the body of a slides column, look
at the automatically checked out example for more details.

## md_split

Very similar to the previous one, but it will support also markdown syntax.

Again have a close look to the provided example for more details.

In this case the structure will be something like:

```
<project-root>
  |- src
    |- 0.html
    |- 1.md
    |- 2.md
    |- 3.html
    |- 4.md
    |- ...
```
