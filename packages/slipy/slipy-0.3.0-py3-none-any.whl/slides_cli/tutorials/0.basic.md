# Basic Introduction

## Create a new project

In order to create a new project just type:

```sh
slipy new <name>
```

By default it will use `reveal.js`, and will create a project in folder named
`<name>` in the current position.

Feel free to move this folder wherever you like on your file-system.

## Initialize the project

A separate step is required to initialize the project.

Indeed before making this step you can customize the options in
`presentation.toml` present in the project directory; for example:

- you can choose the `template` you would like to use for your presentation
  source
- you can choose the `theme`

All the options can be modified also at a later time. Whenever you are ready
simply go inside the project directory and run:

```sh
slipy init
```

### Remark on `$PWD`

With the exception of `new`, `slipy` will expect that you run all the commands
from the project directory you are working in (always the project **root**).

## Start development mode

Simply run:

```sh
slipy preview
```

and a live updating version of your presentation should appear in your default
reader.
