# Presentation structures

Presentation structures to be build with jinja.

The main goals are:

- to have reusable presentations layout
- to organize slides in more files, instead of the single `index.html`, that
  instead is built by jinja

## Organization

Each folder will contain:

- `template.html`: the structure template with jinja syntax
- `structure.toml`: a configuration file to be read with variables configuration
  and further data used in template compile process
