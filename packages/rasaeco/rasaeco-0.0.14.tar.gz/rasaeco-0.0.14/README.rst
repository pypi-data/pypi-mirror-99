RASAECO ("Requirements Analysis for Software in AECO Industry") is a tool
we developed within the `BIMprove Project <https://www.bimprove-h2020.eu/>`_ to
help us analyze the software requirements after the finished elicitation phase.

Installation
------------
Please download and unzip the latest release from
`the GitHub release page <https://github.com/mristin/rasaeco/releases>`_.

Usage
-----
Start your native Windows command prompt.

(Please be careful not to start "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019" or similar
as it includes a 32bit version of Python3 in its environment!)

Change to the directory where you unzipped the release.

Render once
~~~~~~~~~~~
Render the scenarios in-place once:

.. code-block::

    pyrasaeco-render.exe once --scenarios_dir c:\some\path\to\scenarios

(Change ``c:\some\path\to\scenarios`` to fit your system.)

Open the scenario ontology with your browser from:
``c:\some\path\to\scenarios\ontology.html``.

(Don't forget to change ``c:\some\path\to\scenarios`` again to fit 
your system.)

Render continuously
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Monitor the scenario files and re-render on changes:

.. code-block::

    pyrasaeco-render.exe continuously --scenarios_dir c:\some\path\to\scenarios

(Change ``c:\some\path\to\scenarios`` to fit your system.)

Open the scenario ontology with your browser from:
``c:\some\path\to\scenarios\ontology.html``.

(Don't forget to change ``c:\some\path\to\scenarios`` again to fit 
your system.)


Render continuously + automatic refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`pyrasaeco-render` can also start a demo server for you so that you do not have
to manually re-load in the browser. You have to specify the port and the server
will be automatically started:

.. code-block::

    pyrasaeco-render.exe continuously
        --scenarios_dir c:\some\path\to\scenarios
        --port 8000

(Change ``c:\some\path\to\scenarios`` to fit your system.)

The ontology will be available on: ``http://localhost:8000``.

Help
~~~~
.. code-block::

    pyrasaeco-render.exe -h
    pyrasaeco-render.exe once -h
    pyrasaeco-render.exe continuously -h

Cheatsheet
----------

Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Write documents in the following directory structure:

.. code-block::

    ontology/
        some-scenario/
            scenario.md
        some-group/
            another-scenario/
                scenario.md
            yet-another-scenario/
                scenario.md
    ...

The identifier of a scenarios is given by the POSIX path of the scenario directory relative to
the ontology directory.

For example, ``some-scenario`` and ``some-group/another-scenario``.

Header
~~~~~~
Write a ``<rasaeco-meta>`` header at the beginning of a scenario.

Here is an example:

.. code-block::

    <rasaeco-meta>
    {
        "title": "Some Scenario",
        "contact": "Marko Ristin <rist@zhaw.ch>, Somebody Else <somebody@else.ch>",
        "relations": [
            { "target": "some-group/another_scenario", "nature": "is instance of" }
            { "target": "some-group/yet_another_scenario", "nature": "refines" }
        ],
        "volumetric": [
            {
                "aspect_from": "as-planned", "aspect_to": "safety",
                "phase_from": "construction", "phase_to": "construction",
                "level_from": "site", "level_to": "site"
            }
        ]
    }
    </rasaeco-meta>

Tags in the Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tag text in markdown with XML tags.

**Models**.
Models are defined as ``<model name="...">...</model>``.

**Model references** are written using ``<modelref>`` tag:

.. code-block::

    The possible placements for the reception platform should be computed based on
    the <modelref name="observed/main" />.

It is also possible to reference models from another scenario by writing the scenario identifier,
followed by ``#`` and the model name:

.. code-block::

    This is a dummy reference to the model <modelref name="scaffolding#plan/main" />.

**Definitions**.
Definitions are defined ``<def name="...">...</def>``.

If you want to write (pseudo)code in the definition, use ``````` (three backticks):

.. code-block::

    <def name="reception_platform">

    ```bim
    reception_platform
        is IfcBuildingElementType modeled in observed/main
        with .ElementType == "ReceptionPlatform"
    ```

    </def>

In general, give the name using singular form, ``snake_case`` and lower-case. For example,
``reception_platform``.

**Definition references** are written using ``<ref>`` tag:

.. code-block::

    The <ref name="reception_platform" /> can not be appropriately fixed.

It is also possible to reference models from another scenario by writing the scenario identifier,
followed by ``#`` and the definition name:

.. code-block::

    This is a dummy reference to the definition <ref name="scaffolding#scaffold" />.

We apply a couple of text transformations during rendering to improve the readability.
The underscores in the references are replaced with spaces.
If the reference is followed by an "s", it will be automatically inflected to a plural.

For example,

.. code-block::

    The <ref name="misplaced_scaffold" />s are ...

will be rendered to:

.. code-block::

    The misplaced scaffolds are ...

**Marking phase and level**. Use ``<phase>`` and ``<level>`` to mark the phase in
the building life cycle and hierarchy level of detail, respectively.

.. code-block::

    <phase name="planning">During the planning phase, the <ref name="scaffolds" />
    are wrongly planed.</phase>

    <phase name="construction">The <ref name="receptionPlatforms" /> can not be appropriately fixed
    on <level name="site">the site</level>.</phase>

**Test cases**. Test cases are marked using ``<test name="...">...</test>``. You can reference the
individual tests using ``<testref name="..." />``.

Analogous to ``<ref>`` and ``<modelref>``, references to test cases extend across scenarios.

**Acceptance criteria**. Acceptance criteria are marked using ``<acceptance name="...">...</test>``.
You can reference the individual acceptance criteria using ``<acceptanceref name="..." />``.

Analogous to ``<ref>`` and ``<modelref>``, references to acceptance criteria extend
across scenarios.

**References to a scenario as a whole**.
You can reference a scenario from another scenario using ``<scenarioref name="..." />``.

`Sample scenarios <https://github.com/mristin/rasaeco/tree/main/sample_scenarios>`_
for further examples.

Known Issues
------------
Markdown can be sometimes unintuitive when mixed with the mark-up (XML) tags. You have to be careful
when inserting new lines as they are going to be automatically converted by
`marko library <https://pypi.org/project/marko/>`_ to ``<p>``.

This can result in invalid HTML. For example, make sure you do not write:

.. code-block::

    <model name="something">first line

    second line</model>

as this results in invalid HTML:

.. code-block::

    <p><model name="something">first line</p>
    <p>second line</model></p>

Note the inverted ``</p>`` and ``</model>``. This should be correctly written as:

.. code-block::

    <model name="something">

    first line

    second line

    </model>

(Note the empty lines after the opening tag and before the closing tag, respectively.)
