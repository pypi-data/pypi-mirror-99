QtModernRedux
=============

Author: Robert Kist (c) 2021 MIT License

QtModernRedux is a modern dark window and widget theme for PySide2, loosely based on and inspired by
Gerard Marull-Paretas' excellent qtmodern 0.2.0 theme (https://pypi.org/project/qtmodern/, MIT License).

Features
--------
* Consistent looks across platforms (Mac, Windows, Ubuntu) and monitor DPI settings (regular-DPI, high-DPI/4k, Retina)
* Improved support QDialogs: improved icons, support for QDialog's .exec_() method, support for modal dialogs.
* Provides window scaling controls for 8 cardinal directions.
* Provides a 'no-title bar' mode, allowing users to create modern applications with widgets placed directly into the title-bar
  itself, such as Chrome's "tab titlebar", or MS Teams' titlebar.
* Provides a window drop-shadow for window managers which do not support drow shadows by default on Qt frameless windows.
* Provides vector-based hi-res icons, replacing Qt Fusion style's low quality icons, for some platforms.
* Improved themeing of additional widgets, such as QTableView, QListView, etc.
* Works with tools such as PyInstaller and CxFreeze.
* Provides a work-around for using QMediaPlayer on Windows in styled windows.
* Supports definition of custom styles.

Compatibility
-------------
* Python 3.8 or newer
* PySide2 (tested with 5.15.2)

Tested operating systems:
* MacOS Big Sur (regular DPI and Retina)
* Windows 10 (regular and high-DPI)
* Ubuntu 20.10 (regular and high-DPI)
* PopOS 18.04 (regular and high-DPI)

Running the Examples
--------------------
Examples can be found in QtModernRedux's git repository: https://github.com/robertkist/qtmodernredux

Usage
-----
Currently, there is no API documentation, but the included examples in the Git repository should provide a 
good starting point for using QtModernRedux.

Notes
-----

* Windows: Windows places the window-controls (minimize, maximize, close) on the right-hand side, whereas macOS puts them on 
  the left-hand side. For Linux, QtModernRedux puts them on the right-hand side by default. This behaviour can be overridden.
* Windows, Linux: on some systems it is not possible to resize a fully maximized window. This is not a bug.
* Windows: dragging a styled window between screens with different scaling factors results in unpredictable behavior and may
  break the theme. This is a limitation of Qt and how Windows handles application scaling. A work-around may be added
  in future versions of QtModernRedux.
* MacOS: Titlebar-less windows may briefly display a title-bar before being minimized. This is a known limitation
  of Qt and not a bug.
* MacOS: Drop shadow: MacOS Big Sur automaticallys add a drop shadow to QtModernRedux windows. Therefore
  the drop-shadow cannot be controlled or customized on these systems. Drop-shadow settings mostly apply to Linux
  window managers.
* All Platforms: Code overriding this style-sheet, e.g. by calling widgets' .setStyleSheet() method, can potentially break the theme.

Limitations
-----------
* Qt offers an extensive widget library with a plethora of customization options. It is well possible that this theme
does not cover all of them. E.g. custom widgets, such as the LCD display widget or the calendar widget, are not covered.
* The goal of this project is not to cover every widget (although it would be nice to eventually achieve this), but 
to cover the most commonly used ones.

Customization
-------------
Have a look at ```src/examples/customstyle``` for an example of a custom style (wow_style).
Styles have 2 parts: styles for the window frame (windowstyle) and the individual widgets (widgetstyle).

Tips:
* do not remove any of the pre-defined constants (see constants.py in windowstyle and widgetstyle directories)
* try to work with the pre-defined constants as much as possible. Many of them are used in qtmodernredux's code
  to enable its functionality.
* some sub-controls of widgets have been disabled (e.g. width set to 0, colors set to transparent, etc.) because they may
  cause problems
