Description: # Tensorforce: a TensorFlow library for applied reinforcement learning
        Tensorforce is an open-source deep reinforcement learning framework, with an emphasis on modularized flexible library design and straightforward usability for applications in research and practice. Tensorforce is built on top of [Google's TensorFlow framework](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and requires Python 3.
        
        Tensorforce follows a set of high-level design choices which differentiate it from other similar libraries:
        
        - **Modular component-based design**: Feature implementations, above all, strive to be as generally applicable and configurable as possible, potentially at some cost of faithfully resembling details of the introducing paper.
        - **Separation of RL algorithm and application**: Algorithms are agnostic to the type and structure of inputs (states/observations) and outputs (actions/decisions), as well as the interaction with the application environment.
        - **Full-on TensorFlow models**: The entire reinforcement learning logic, including control flow, is implemented in TensorFlow, to enable portable computation graphs independent of application programming language, and to facilitate the deployment of models.
