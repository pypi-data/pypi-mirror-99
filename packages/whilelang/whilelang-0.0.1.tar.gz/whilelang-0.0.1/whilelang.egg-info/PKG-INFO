Description: # Whilelang
        
        Usage: `python while.py source.while [...arguments]`
        
        ## Implemented grammar
        
        The grammar implemented here is slightly different to the definitions of While
        that can be found online, largely for ease of implementation.
        
        ```
        <suite> = EOF
                | "(" <suite> ")"
                | <statement> *(";" <statement>)
        <statement> = "skip"
                    | "while" <expr_a> "do" <suite>
                    | "if" <expr_a> "then" <suite> ["else" <suite>]
                    | NAME ":=" <expr_a>
        <factor> = [("!" | "Â¬")] (NAME | NUMBER | BOOLEAN | "(" <expr_a> ")")
        <expr_f> = <factor> [("*" | "/") <factor>]
        <expr_e> = <expr_f> [("+" | "-") <expr_f>]
        <expr_d> = <expr_e> [("<=" | "<" | ">=" | ">") <expr_e>]
        <expr_c> = <expr_d> ["=" <expr_d>]
        <expr_b> = <expr_c> ["&" <expr_c>]
        <expr_a> = <expr_b> ["|" <expr_b>]
        ```
        
        This logic can be seen implemented as code in `parser.py`. Compared to the
        simpler grammars often quoted, this grammar provides proper operator
        precedence.
