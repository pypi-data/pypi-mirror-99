        Package to retrieve PV information form the growatt server.
        
        Special thanks to [Sjoerd Langkemper](https://github.com/Sjord) who has provided a strong base to start off from https://github.com/Sjord/growatt_api_client
        These projects may merge in the future since they are simmilar in code and function.
        ## Usage
        ```
        import growattServer
        
        api = growattServer.GrowattApi()
        login_response = api.login(<username>, <password>)
        #Get a list of growatt plants.
        print(api.plant_list(login_response['userId']))
        ```
        ## Methods and Variables
        ### Methods
        Any methods that may be useful.
        
        `api.login(username, password)` Log into the growatt api. This must be done before making any request. after this you will be logged in. you will want to capture the response to get the `userId` variable.
        
        `api.plant_list(user_id)` Get a list of plants registered to your account.
        
        `api.plant_info(plant_id)` Get info for specified plant.
        
        `api.plant_detail(plant_id, timespan<1=day, 2=month>, date)` Get details of a specific plant.
        
        `api.inverter_list(plant_id)` Get a list of inverters in specified plant. (May be deprecated in the future, since it gets all devices. Use device_list instead)
        
        `api.device_list(plant_id)` Get a list of devices in specified plant.
        
        `api.inverter_data(inverter_id, date)` Get some basic data of a specific date for the inverter.
        
        `api.inverter_detail(inverter_id)` Get detailed data on inverter.
        
        `api.tlx_data(tlx_id, date)` Get some basic data of a specific date for the tlx type inverter.
        
        `api.tlx_detail(tlx_id)` Get detailed data on a tlx type inverter.
        
        `api.mix_info(mix_id, plant_id=None)` Get high level information about the Mix system including daily and overall totals. NOTE: plant_id is an optional parameter, it does not appear to be used by the remote API, but is used by the mobile app these calls were reverse-engineered from.
        
        `api.mix_totals(mix_id, plant_id)` Get daily and overall total information for the Mix system (duplicates some of the information from `mix_info`
        
        `api.mix_system_status(mix_id, plant_id)` Get instantaneous values for Mix system e.g. current import/export, generation, charging rates etc.
        
        `api.mix_detail(mix_id, plant_id, timespan=<0=hour, 1=day, 2=month>, date)` Get detailed values for a timespan, the API call also returns totals data for the same values in this time window
        
        `api.dashboard_data(plant_id, timespan=<0=hour, 1=day, 2=month>, date)` Get dashboard values for a timespan, the API call also returns totals data for the same values in this time window. NOTE: Many of the values on this API call are incorrect for 'Mix' systems, however it still provides some accurate values that are unavailable on other API calls.
        
        `api.storage_detail(storage_id)` Get detailed data on storage (battery).
        
        `api.storage_params(storage_id)` Get a ton of info on storage (More info, more convoluted).
        
        `api.storage_energy_overview(plant_id, storage_id)` Get the information you see in the "Generation overview".
        
        ### Variables
        Some variables you may want to set.
        
        `api.server_url` The growatt server url, default: 'http://server.growatt.com/'
        ## Note
        This is based on the endpoints used on the mobile app and could be changed without notice.
