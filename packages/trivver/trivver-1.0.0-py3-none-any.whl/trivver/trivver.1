trivver - compare version strings in all their varied glory

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
The \fBtrivver\fR utility exposes some of the functions in the \fBtrivver\fR
Python library via a command-line interface.\&
Just as the underlying Python library, this utility does not strive for
completeness in the formats of version strings that it supports.\&
Some version strings sorted by its rules are:
.RS 4

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

In particular, note that "1.\&0a" is considered greater than "1.\&0";
alpha/beta/pre-release versions are indicated by another dot, as in
"1.\&0.\&a".\&
.P
The \fBtrivver\fR utility provides three commands:
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
\fBcompare\fR: compare two version strings 
.br
  The \fBcompare\fR subcommand takes two version strings as arguments and
outputs a single character followed by a newline.\&
The character is "<", ">", or "=", if the left version string
represents a version that is respectively less than, greater than, or
the same as the one represented by the right version string.\&

.RE
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
\fBverify\fR: check whether a relation holds 
.br
  The \fBverify\fR subcommand checks whether the two specified version strings
are indeed in the specified relation.\&
If so, the \fBtrivver\fR utility will exit with a status code of 0.\&
If not, the exit status will be 1.\&
The relation may be one of "<", ">", "=", "<=", ">=", "!\&=",
"lt", "gt", "eq", "le", "ge", or "ne".\&

.RE
.P
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.IP \(bu 4
.\}
\fBsort\fR: read version strings and output them in sorted order 
.br
  The \fBsort\fR subcommand reads a list of version strings from the standard
input stream, one per line, then prints them out on the standard output
stream in sorted order.\&

.RE
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
The operation of the \fBtrivver\fR utility is not directly influenced by
any environment variables.\&
.P
.SH FILES
.P
The operation of the \fBtrivver\fR utility is not directly influenced by
the contents of any files.\&
.P
.SH EXAMPLES
.P
Compare two version numbers; the result should be a single ">" line:
.P
.RS 4
trivver compare 1.\&0 0.\&5
.P
.RE
Make sure the above relation holds:
.P
.RS 4
if trivver verify 0.\&5 lt 1.\&0; then echo yes; else echo no; fi
.P
.RE
Sort a list of version strings:
.P
.RS 4
trivver sort < versions.\&txt
.P
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.P
If run with the \fBcompare\fR or \fBsort\fR subcommands, the \fBtrivver\fR utility
will exit 0 on success and >0 if an error occurs.\&
.P
If run with the \fBverify\fR subcommand, the \fBtrivver\fR utility will exit with
0 or 1 depending on whether the specified relation holds.\&
Any other exit status indicates an error.\&

The \fBtrivver\fR command-line utility was written in 2021.\&
