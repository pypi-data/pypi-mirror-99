Description: # About
        
        `multi-key-graph` is a command line tool that invokes `matplotlib` to
        plot multiple keys on multiple graphs from an FSDB/pyfsdb data file
        (tab-separated with a header).
        
        # Installation
        
        ```
        pip3 install multikeygraph
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        `multi-key-graph` is designed to:
        
        1. read in time-series data in FSDB format
        2. Plot data in columns (-c COLNAME1 ...) for a given key column value (-k KEY).
        3. Which key values to be plotted can be limited to a fixed list (-l VAL1 VAL2 ...)
        4. Save the results to an output PNG file (-o OUT.png) or a window (-i)
        
        If multiple columns are specified, the output will contain multiple
        vertically stacked graphs with aligned X-axes allowing for easier
        comparison of noisy time-series plots.
        
        Plot labels can be specified using -T TITLE, --xlabel X-LABEL, and
        --ylabel Y-LABEL.  By default line plots are drawn, unless a
        dotted/scatter plot (-s) is requested.  Data should be pre-sorted for
        line graphs.
        
        A list of name=replacement values can be passed for legende name
        replacements (-L name=replacement).  Anonymization of key values may
        be specified with an anonymization pattern that includes a %d
        specifier (-A "some%d").
