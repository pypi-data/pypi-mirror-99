### Importing/exporting feeds from another client

castero supports importing and exporting an [OPML file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML)
of your subscriptions in order to easily transfer them between other podcast
clients. Please refer to your other client's documentation for details on
how/if it supports this format.

Importing and exporting from castero are available with command line flags.
Run `castero --help` for details.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `{HOME}/.config/castero/castero.conf`
after the client has been run at least once.

Please see the [default castero.conf](https://github.com/xgi/castero/blob/master/castero/templates/castero.conf)
for a list of available settings.

User data, including downloaded episodes and a database with your feed
information, is located at `{HOME}/.local/share/castero/`. These files are not
intended to be manually modified. Removing the database will simply cause
castero to replace it with an empty one the next time you run the client.

## Testing

This project uses [pytest](https://pytest.org) for testing. To run tests, run
the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ python -m pytest tests
```

You can also run tests for an individual unit, i.e.:

```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/test_feed.py
```
