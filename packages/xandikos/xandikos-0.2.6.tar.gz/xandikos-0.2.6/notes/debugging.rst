Debugging Xandikos
==================

When filing bugs, please include details on the Xandikos version you're running
and the clients that you're using.

It would be helpful if you can reproduce any issues with a clean Xandikos
setup. That also makes it easier to e.g. share log files.

1. Verify the server side contents; you can do this by
   looking at the Git repository on the Xandikos side.
2. Run with ``xandikos --dump-dav-xml``; please note that these
   may contain personal information, so be careful before e.g. posting
   them on GitHub.
