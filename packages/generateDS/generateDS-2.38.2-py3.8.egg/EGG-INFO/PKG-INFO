        generateDS.py generates Python data structures (for example, class
        definitions) from an XML Schema document.  These data structures
        represent the elements in an XML document described by the XML
        Schema.  It also generates parsers that load an XML document into
        those data structures.  In addition, a separate file containing
        subclasses (stubs) is optionally generated.  The user can add
        methods to the subclasses in order to process the contents of an
        XML document.
