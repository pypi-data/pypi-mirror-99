Description: # twarc-ids
        
        This module is a simple example of how to create a plugin for [twarc]. It uses
        [click-plugins] to extend the main twarc command, and to manage the command
        line options.
        
        First you need to install twarc and this plugin:
        
            pip install twarc
            pip install twarc-ids
        
        Now you can collect data using the core twarc utility:
        
            twarc search blacklivesmatter > tweets.jsonl
        
        And you have a new subcommand `ids` that is supplied by twarc-ids.
        
            twarc ids tweets.jsonl > ids.txt
        
        It's good practice to include some tests for your module. See
        [test_twarc_ids.py] for an example. You can run these with [pytest]:
        
            pytest
        
        When creating your setup.py make sure you don't forget the [entry_points magic]
        so that twarc will find your plugin when it is installed!
