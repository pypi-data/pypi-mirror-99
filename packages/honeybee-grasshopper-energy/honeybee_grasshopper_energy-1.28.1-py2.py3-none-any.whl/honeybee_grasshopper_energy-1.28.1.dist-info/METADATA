# honeybee-grasshopper-energy

:honeybee: :green_book: :fire: Honeybee Energy plugin for Grasshopper (aka. honeybee[+]).

This repository contains all energy modeling Grasshopper components for the honeybee
plugin. The package includes both the userobjects (`.ghuser`) and the Python
source (`.py`). Note that this library only possesses the Grasshopper components
and, in order to run the plugin, the core libraries must be installed in a way that
they can be found by Rhino (see dependencies).
