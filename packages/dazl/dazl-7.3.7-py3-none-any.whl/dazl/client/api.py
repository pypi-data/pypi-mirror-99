# NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS
#
# This file contains only public API definitions, overloads, and documentation. (This file should
# be treated more like a C header file than anything else.) The bulk of the implementation is kept
# in _party_client.py.
#
# This file is repetitive and tedious, but written this way primarily so that static typing tools
# do the right thing. Python's ``typing`` library (and mypy) aren't quite expressive enough to allow
# for a more concise representation of the various flavors of the API. The unit test
# ``test_api_consistency.py`` verifies that these implementations are generally in sync with each
# other the way that the documentation says they are.
"""
This module contains the public API for interacting with the ledger from the perspective of a
specific party.
