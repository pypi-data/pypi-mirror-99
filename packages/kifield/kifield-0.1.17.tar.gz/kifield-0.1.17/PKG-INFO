        A utility for manipulating part fields in KiCad schematic files or libraries.
        KiField can extract all the component fields from a schematic or library
        and place them into a spreadsheet for bulk editing, after which you can insert the
        edited values from the spreadsheet back into the schematic or library.
        
        KiField is usually employed in a three-step process:
        
        #. First use KiField to extract the part field labels and values from a
           schematic or library and place them into a CSV or XLSX spreadsheet file.
        
        #. Edit the spreadsheet file to change existing field values, add entirely
           new fields, or completely delete fields.
        
        #. Finally, use KiField to insert the updated field labels and values from
           the spreadsheet file into the schematic or library.

        Features
        --------
        
        * Extracts all fields and values from one or more KiCad schematic libraries or files
          (even hierarchical designs), and inserts them into a spreadsheet (either
          CSV or XLSX format).
        * Extracts all fields and values from one or more CSV or XLSX spreadsheet files
          and inserts them into one or more KiCad schematics or libraries.

        ______________________
        
        * Part fields are cleaned up if they contain newlines.
        * Lines in a schematic file which were broken by a newline within a quoted string are rejoined.
        * Generated spreadsheet cells have their format set to TEXT if they contain a string.

        ______________________
        
        * Line-feeds and carriage-returns are stripped from strings inserted into .sch or .lib files.
        * Fixed error where reading .lib files was ignoring the first line after the EESchema-LIBRARY header and missing a part DEF.
