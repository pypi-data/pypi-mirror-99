Description: # Wakeywakey!
        
        Do you have a EC2 instance that you only need during certain hours of the day? Do you want to reduce it's cost? Are you using the [@matthewbonig/nightynight](https://github.com/mbonig/nightynight) construct to shut it down every night? Do you want to start it up in the morning?
        
        That's the Wakeywakey construct. It's very simple. Give it an `instanceId` and it will create a Lambda and a CloudWatch Event Rule to fire the lambda at a specific time of day. If the instance is stopped, it is started.
        
        # This is a pre-release!
        
        This is a quick first-draft. All the options that will likely need to be added to accomodate a large
        number of use-cases are still needed. If you'd like to make requests or help update this construct, please
        open an [Issue](https://github.com/mbonig/wakeywakey/issues) or a [PR](https://github.com/mbonig/cicd-spa-website/pulls).
        
        # What is creates

        * A Rule that will, on a given schedule, fire a lambda.
        * A Lambda with permissions to describe ec2 instances. It will read the instance by the given `instanceId` and then start the instance if it's in a stopped state.
        
        # Example:
        
        ```python
        # Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
        class WakeyWakeyStack(Stack):
        
            def __init__(self, scope, id, props):
                super().__init__(scope, id, props)
        
                # The code that defines your stack goes here
                WakeyWakey(self, "wakeywakey", instance_id="i-123123123123")
        ```
        
        This will start the instance with id `i-123123123123` at (the default) 4am GMT.
