        Products.MeetingCommunes Changelog
        ==================================
        
        The Products.MeetingCommunes version must be the same as the Products.PloneMeeting version
        
        4.1.23 (2021-03-23)
        -------------------
        
        - Backport from 4.2.x:
        
          - When using finances advice workflows, WF `initial_state` may vary
            (`advicecreated`, `proposed_to_financial_controller`, ...) so when using
            completeness, check that item is complete until the
            `mayProposeToFinancialReviewer` transition guard.

        4.1.22 (2021-03-04)
        -------------------
        
        - Backport from 4.2.x:
        
          - Added new external method to ease the switch to proposingGroupWithGroupInCharge.
            [odelaere]
          - Added 2 new profiles `zcodir_extended` and `zcodir_city_cpas`.
            [aduchene]
          - Removed default values defined for DashboardCollections `FINANCE_ADVICES_COLLECTION_ID`
            and `searchitemswithnofinanceadvice`, because if it does not exist in the
            `MeetingConfig.customAdvisers`, it breaks the dashboards when applying the profile.

            unrestricted was not propagated to sub methods giving nonsense results.
            [gbastien]
          - Added parameter `additional_catalog_query={}` to
