Description: 
        This library provides details for pybind11 such that an interface to NumPy arrays is automatically
        provided when including a function that takes any of the xtensor classes as (return) argument(s).
        
        Note that this library is simpler but more naive than xtensor-python as arguments are always copies
        of the NumPy arrays. This simplifies the Python wrapper code greatly, but comes at the prices of
        having to copy.
        
        This library also provides a small Python library that can be used to compile the wrapper code using
        a 'setup.py'.
