    This is a wrapping of :class:`multiprocessing.Process` that follows the API of
    :func:`trio.to_thread.run_sync`. The intended use of this function is limited:

    - Circumvent the GIL to run CPU-bound functions in parallel
    - Make blocking APIs or infinite loops truly cancellable through
      SIGKILL/TerminateProcess without leaking resources
    - Protect the main process from untrusted/unstable code without leaks

    Other :mod:`multiprocessing` features may work but are not officially
    supported, and all the normal :mod:`multiprocessing` caveats apply. The
    underlying worker processes are cached LIFO and reused to minimize latency.
    Global state cannot be considered stable between and across calls.

    Args:
      sync_fn: An importable or pickleable synchronous callable. See the
          :mod:`multiprocessing` documentation for detailed explanation of
          limitations.
      *args: Positional arguments to pass to sync_fn. If you need keyword
          arguments, use :func:`functools.partial`.
      cancellable (bool): Whether to allow cancellation of this operation.
          Cancellation always involves abrupt termination of the worker process
          with SIGKILL/TerminateProcess. To obtain correct semantics with CTRL+C,
          SIGINT is ignored when raised in workers.
      limiter (None, or trio.CapacityLimiter):
          An object used to limit the number of simultaneous processes. Most
          commonly this will be a `~trio.CapacityLimiter`, but any async
          context manager will succeed.

    Returns:
      Any: Whatever ``sync_fn(*args)`` returns.

    Raises:
      BaseException: Whatever ``sync_fn(*args)`` raises.
      BrokenWorkerError: Indicates the worker died unexpectedly. Not encountered
        in normal use.
