An instance of {class}`~snowmobile.Snowmobile`, 
<a class="fixture-sn" href="../index.html#fixture-sn"></a>, represents a distinct 
[session](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/current_session.html)

with which it was instantiated.

```{div} sn-dedent-v-t-h, sn-dedent-v-b-h
Its purpose is to provide an entry point that will:
```
1.  Locate, parse, and instantiate [snowmobile.toml](./snowmobile_toml.md#snowmobiletoml) 
    as a {class}`~snowmobile.Configuration` object, 
    {attr}`sn.cfg <snowmobile.core.connection.Snowmobile.cfg>`
1.  Establish connections to {xref}`snowflake`
1.  Store the {xref}`SnowflakeConnection`, 
    {attr}`sn.con <snowmobile.core.connection.Snowmobile.con>`, and execute commands 
    against the database

 The [default snowmobile.toml](./snowmobile_toml.md#file-contents) contains
 scaffolding for two sets of credentials, aliased `creds1` and `creds2` 
 respectively.

 By changing `default-creds = ''` to `default-creds = 'creds2'`, 
 [Snowmobile](/usage/snowmobile) will use the credentials from `creds2` 
 regardless of where it falls relative to all the other credentials stored.

````````{div} sn-tabbed-section

 ```````{tabbed} -
 ```{div} sn-hanging-p
 Sometimes it's helpful to create a {class}`~snowmobile.Snowmobile` without 
 establishing a connection; this is accomplished with:
 ```
 
 ```{code-block} python
 :emphasize-lines: 3,3
 import snowmobile
 
 sn = snowmobile.connect(delay=True)
 ```
 
 When provided with `delay=True`, the 
 <a class="fixture-sn" href="../index.html#fixture-sn"></a> that's returned omits 
 connecting to {xref}`snowflake` upon its instantiation; its 
 {attr}`~snowmobile.Snowmobile.con` attribute is *None*, but its 
 {attr}`~snowmobile.Snowmobile.cfg` attribute is a
 fully valid {class}`~snowmobile.core.configuration.Configuration` object.
 
 See the tabbed *Examples* for additional information.

 attribute of <a class="fixture-sn" href="../index.html#fixture-sn"></a> will

 If such a method is invoked, a call is made by 
 <a class="fixture-sn" href="../index.html#fixture-sn"></a> to
 {xref}`snowflake.connector.connect()`, a connection established, and the 
 attribute set.

 A full path ({class}`pathlib.Path` or {class}`str`) to a

 1. Testing different sets of configuration options without altering the

 1. Binding a specific configuration with a process for sql-parsing purposes 
 1. Hard coding the configuration source in processes that have access to 
    limited file systems (e.g. containers or VMs)

 ```````{tabbed} From File Name
 [Snowmobile](#snowmobile) caches locations based on the file **name** 
 provided to the `config_file_nm` parameter of {meth}`snowmobile.connect()`,
 the default value of which is `snowmobile.toml`.
 
 If an alternate file name is provided, it will be located and its location
 cached in the same way as the global [snowmobile.toml](./snowmobile_toml.md) 
 file so that future instances of 
 <a class="fixture-sn" href="../index.html#fixture-sn"></a> 
 on the same machine can make use of it upon instantiation without having to
 re-locate it.
