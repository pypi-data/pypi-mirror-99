        =========
        
        Linux Software to print with LabelManager PnP from Dymo
        
        
        * First version from Sebastian Bronner: https://sbronner.com/dymoprint.html
        * Cloned by computerlyrik to: https://github.com/computerlyrik/dymoprint
        * Forked by Ben Mares on 2020-10-05 to: https://github.com/maresb/dymoprint
        * [Pull request](https://github.com/computerlyrik/dymoprint/pull/35) sent to computerlyrik on 2020-10-05 with update and offering PyPI ownership.
        * After no response, assumed that computerlyrik's fork is abandoned, continuing development from fork on 2021-03-22.
        
        ## Features
        
        * Works on python 2.7 and 3.5 to 3.8
        * Supports text printing
        * Supports qr code printing
        * Supports barcode printing
        * Supports image printing
        * Supports combined barcode / qrcode and text printing
        
        ## Installation & Configuration
        ### Dependent packages
        
        From this directory,
        
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
        
        or for development,
        
        ```bash
        pip install --editable .
        ```
        
        Add the `--user` flag to install in userspace.
        
        #### For ubuntu based distributions:
        (should also work for debian, but not tested yet)
        use **udev** and **modeswitch** configurations to work with the LabelManager PNP.
        **modeswitch** changes the mode (and USB Id) from mass storage device to printer device.
        
            sudo cp 91-dymo-labelmanager-pnp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
            sudo cp dymo-labelmanager-pnp.conf /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/    
            
        and restart services with:
          
            sudo systemctl restart udev.service
        
        Finally, physically disconnect and reconnect the LabelManager PnP.
        
        ([more info](http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?t=947))
        
        
        #### For arch based distributions:
        (should also work for manjaro, but not tested yet)
        use **udev** and **modeswitch** configurations to work with the LabelManager PNP.
        **modeswitch** changes the mode (and USB Id) from mass storage device to printer device.
        
        Install **usb_modeswitch** at first:
        
            sudo pacman -S usb_modeswitch
        
        if the **/etc/usb_modeswitch.d/** folder was not created at installation do:
        
            sudo mkdir /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/
        
        now copy the udev and usb_modswitch configs:
        
            sudo cp 91-dymo-labelmanager-pnp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
            sudo cp dymo-labelmanager-pnp.conf /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/    
            
        and restart services with:
          
            sudo udevadm control --reload
        
        you might need to change the permissions of the hid device (dymoprint will tell if it is the case):
        
            sudo chown your_user:users /dev/hidraw0 
        
        Finally, physically disconnect and reconnect the LabelManager PnP.

        ### Font management
        
        Fonts are managed via **dymoprint.ini**. This should be placed in your
        config folder (normally `~/.config`). An example file is provided here.
        
        You may choose any TTF Font you like
        
        You may edit the file to point to your favorite font.
        
        For my Arch-Linux System, fonts are located at e.g.
        
        	/usr/share/fonts/TTF/DejaVuSerif.ttf
        
        It is also possible to Download a font from
        http://font.ubuntu.com/ and use it.
        
        ## Modes
        ### Print text
        ```./dymoprint MyText```
        
        Multilines will be generated on whitespace
        
        ```./dymoprint MyLine MySecondLine # Will print two Lines```
        
        If you want whitespaces just enclose in " "
        
        ```./dymoprint "prints a single line"```
        
        ### Print QRCodes and Barcodes
        ```./dymoprint --help```
        
        ### Print Codes and Text
        just add a text after your qr or barcode text
        
        ```./dymoprint -qr "QR Content" "Cleartext printed"```
        
        ### Picture printing
        Any picture with JPEG standard may be printed. Beware it will be downsized to tape.
        
        ```./dymoprint -p mypic.jpg ""```
        
        Take care of the trailing "" - you may enter text here which gets printed in front of the image
        
        ## Development 
        Besides the travis-ci one should run the following command on a feature implemention or change to ensure the same outcome on a real device:
        ```
        ./dymoprint Tst && \
        ./dymoprint -qr Tst && \
        ./dymoprint -c code128 Tst && \
        ./dymoprint -qr qrencoded "qr_txt" && \
        ./dymoprint -c code128 Test "bc_txt"
        ```
        
        
        ### ToDo
        - (?)support multiple ProductIDs (1001, 1002) -> use usb-modeswitch?
        - put everything in classes that would need to be used by a GUI
        - ~~for more options use command line parser framework~~
        - ~~allow selection of font with command line options~~
        - allow font size specification with command line option (points, pixels?)
        - ~~provide an option to show a preview of what the label will look like~~
        - ~~read and write a .dymoprint file containing user preferences~~
        - ~~print barcodes~~
        - ~~print graphics~~
        - ~~plot frame around label~~
        - vertical print
