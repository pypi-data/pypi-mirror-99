It uses the Spark Python API to execute data linking jobs in a Spark cluster.  It has been tested in Apache Spark 2.3 and 2.4.\n\nInstall splink using\n\n`pip install splink`\n\n## Interactive demo\n\nYou can run demos of `splink` in an interactive Jupyter notebook by clicking the button below:\n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/moj-analytical-services/splink_demos/master?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe best documentation is currently a series of demonstrations notebooks in the [splink_demos](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink_demos) repo.\n\nWe also provide an interactive `splink` settings editor and example settings [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink_settings_editor/).  A tool to generate custom `m` and `u` probabilities can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/@robinl/m-and-u-probabilities).\n\nThe statistical model behind `splink` is the same as that used in the R [fastLink package](https://github.com/kosukeimai/fastLink).  Accompanying the fastLink package is an [academic paper](http://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/linkage.pdf) that describes this model.  This is the best place to start for users wanting to understand the theory about how `splink` works.\n\nYou can read a short blog post about `splink` [here](https://robinlinacre.com/introducing_splink/).\n\n## Videos\n\nYou can find a short video introducing `splink` and running though an introductory demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8lV2Lbd6Xs&feature=youtu.be&t=1295).\n\nA 'best practices and performance tuning' tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzcqrRvXhCE).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are very grateful to [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/) (Administrative Data Research UK) for providing funding for this work as part of the [Data First](https://www.adruk.org/our-work/browse-all-projects/data-first-harnessing-the-potential-of-linked-administrative-data-for-the-justice-system-169/) project.\n\nWe are also very grateful to colleagues at the UK's Office for National Statistics for their expert advice and peer review of this work.\n",
