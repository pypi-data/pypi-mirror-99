Archey4 is a **maintained** fork of the original Archey Linux system tool.
The original Archey program had been written by Melik Manukyan in 2009, and quickly abandoned in 2011.
At first, it only supported Arch Linux distribution, further support had been added afterwards.
Many forks popped in the wild due to inactivity, but this one attends since 2017 to succeed where the others failed:
Remain *maintained*, *community-driven* and *highly-compatible* with yesterday's and today's systems.\
