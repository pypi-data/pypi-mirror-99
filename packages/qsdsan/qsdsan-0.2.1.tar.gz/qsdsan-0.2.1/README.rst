What is ``QSDsan``?
-------------------
``QSDsan`` is a package for the quantitative sustainable design of sanitation and resource recovery systems leveraging the structure and modules developed in ``BioSTEAM`` [1]_. As an open-source and impact-driven platform, ``QSDsan`` aims to identify configuration combinations, systematically probe interdependencies across technologies, and identify key sensitivities to contextual assumptions through the use of quantitative sustainable design methods (techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment and under uncertainty). 


Installation
------------
First install the package at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_. If you use pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install qsdsan

Note that development of this package is currently under initial stage with limited backward compatibility, please feel free to submit an issue for any questions regarding package upgrading.
