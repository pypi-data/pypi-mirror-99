VERSION    DATE          DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V3.0.4     2021-03-19    FIXED: 
			  * Replaced MUSE_WFMAO read-in routine by MUSE_WFMAON and 
			    MUSE_WFMAOE to account for the distinct wavelength ranges 
			    affected by the LGS facility in the nominal and extended modes
			    of the MUSE wide-field mode. 
			    Thanks to Aishwarya Girdhar for pointing out this bug.
			  * Fixed Mapviewer, gandalf.py, and gistPlot_kin.py to work with 
			    only two kinematic moments. Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for 
			    reporting these issues. 
			  * Account for the correct de-redshifting of sky-masks in 
			    pyGandALF. Thanks to Andrew Battisti for the suggestion. 

V3.0.3     2020-12-11    FIXED: 
			  * Change MUSE read-in routines to read pixelsize from header
			  * Correct wavelength range affected by laser guide stars in MUSE 
			    adaptive optics read-in routines. Masking now extends to 6050A
			  * Fixed Mapviewer to show wavelengths in Angstrom if only a 
			    plain spectrum (without any other analysis) is displayed.
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for pointing out these bugs. 

V3.0.2     2020-10-19    FIXED:
			  * Fixed typo in log-messages from read-in routines
			  * Fixed bug in gandalf.py that prevented some output columns to
			    be written to disk. Thanks to Andrew Battisti for pointing
			    out these two issues. 

V3.0.1     2020-09-03    CHANGED: 
			  * Assure compatibility with pPXF version 7 by adopting the 
			    _bvls_solve and nnls_flags from pPXF version 6 into pyGandALF.
			    Thanks to Michele Cappellari for his permission to include 
			    these functions. 
			  * Relaxed version dependencies of other packages in setup.py.
			  * Changed the default value of the ftol parameter in pyGandALF 
			    to 1e-5, in order to improve the reliability of the fit.

V3.0       2020-08-20    Substantial revision and restructuring of the source code. Please
			 consider the documentation for a detailed description of all 
			 changes. 

V2.1       2020-04-06	 CHANGED: 
			  * Changed definition of npad variable in Gandalf analogue 
			    to PPXF. Thanks to Alireza Molaeinezhad for the suggestion. 
			  * Check dimensions of templates at read-in to allow the use of 
			    Miles stars. Thanks to Thomas Spriggs for the suggestion. 
			  * Modified CALIFA read-in routines to pass variances in 
			    error spectra. 
			 FIXED:
			  * Added missing np.sqrt in the calculation of error spectra
			    of bins consisting of single spaxels. Thanks to Sebastien 
			    Comeron for reporting this bug. 
			  * Neglect negative BIN_IDs in the calculation of the reference 
			    velocity in Mapviewer. Thanks to Isabel PÃ©rez. 
			  * Enable DEBUG-mode in read-in routines by passing shape of cube
			    Thanks to Adriano Poci for reporting this bug. 
			  * Mapviewer: Plot the spectrum of the nearest valid bin if a bin
			    outside of the Voronoi-region is selected. 
			    Thanks to Michela Rubino. 

V2.0.0     2019-11-13    ADDED: 
			  * Support different wavelength ranges in different modules,
			    including a separate wavelength range for the SNR calculation.
			  * Support AO in MUSE wide- and narrow-field mode
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for the suggestion. 
			  * Support of sky-lines in spectralMasking_*.config
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for the suggestion. 
			 CHANGED: 
			  * Propagate defunct spaxels through the pipeline

V1.1.1     2019-10-31    FIXED: 
			  * Apply de-redshifting to laser wavelength range in MUSE_NFM.py
			  * Apply de-redshifting to LSF
			    Thanks to Sebastien Comeron for reporting these bugs. 

V1.1.0     2019-08-16    ADDED:   
			  * Allow different initial guesses for different bins in pPXF
			    Thanks to Michela Rubino for the suggestion. 
			  * Read-in routine for single spectra in txt-format "PLAINTXT.py"
	      	   	 FIXED:   
			  * spectralMasking_SFH.config to handle one or zero masks
	      	   	  * Orientation of maps in plotting routines
	      	   	  * GandALF taking into account the LSF in doublet lines
	      	   	 CHANGED:
			  * Use stellar kinematics as initial guess on GandALF fit
	      	   	  * Use np.nansum instead of np.nanmean to co-add spectra into 
			    Voronoi-bins
	      	   	  * Pass ORIGIN in units of pixels
	      	   	 REMOVED:
			  * *_gandalf-residuals_*.fits output

V1.0.0     2019-06-11    Release of first version
