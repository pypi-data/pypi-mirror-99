The DecisionTree() class is so awesome it deserves to be in a file of its own. Powered by Cython and parallel processing
it's remarkably fast and it also has a good amount of unprecedented functionality.

class DecisionTree:
    """
    Decision Trees are powerful algorithms that create a tree by looking at the data and finding what questions are best
    to ask? For example if you are trying to predict whether somebody has cancer it may ask, "Do they have cells with
    a size >= 5?" or "Is there any history of smoking or drinking in the family?" These algorithms can easily fit most
    datasets, and are very well capable of overfitting (luckily we offer some parameters to help with that.)

    If you are going to be using categorical features with this Decision Tree, make sure to one hot encode it. You can
    do that with the one_hot() function in the utils module.

    This Decision Tree class doesn't support regression, or any labels that have continuous values. It is only for
    classification tasks. The reason this is such is because most curves and lines can be formed or modeled better with
    regression algorithms (Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, etc. are all available in the regression module) or neural networks.
    Decision Trees will typically overfit on such tasks.

    ----
    Methods :

    __init__(max_branches = math.inf, min_samples = 1) :
        Both these two parameters prevent overfitting, each pretty simple and easy to understand.

        ->> max_branches are the maximum number of branches the tree can have. It can very from 4 to 1000, depending on
        the number of features and the complexity of the task. You may be wondering why the default is math.inf - it's basically
        saying that there is no threshold for how many branches there can be. This prevents overfitting as you would much
        rather have a model with 200 branches that makes a few errors on the training set but generalizes well instead
        of a model with 1000 branches that gets everything in the training set but a lot less in the test.

        ->> min_samples is the minimum number of samples a branch needs to continue to split. If a decision tree is
        overfitting, you may notice it will create a bunch of trees just to fit one or two data points. By putting min_samples
        to 5 for example, what you are doing is making sure that the tree is not just trying to satisfy every point
        at the expense of overfitting but rather generalize to the whole. If there are less samples in a branch than the
        min_samples parameter, that branch will not split and will become a leaf (node) with the most common label.

    fit(x_train, y_train) :
        ->> x_train is the data, must be in a python list/numpy array that is 2D ([[]] not [])
            ->> remember to one_hot() any categorical features
        ->> y_train is the data, must be in a python list/numpy array that is 1D.

    predict(x_test) :
        ->> x_test is the data you want to be predicted. It must be 2D.
        ->> this method uses parallel predicting to make things go faster

    evaluate(x_test, y_test) :
        ->> x_test is your testing data (2D)
        ->> y_test is your labels (1D)

    average_branches() :
        ->> we understand that finding a good value for the max_branches parameter can be tricky, so this method
        gives the average number of branches that your tree has with the current parameters. It is not **exact** but it
        is a good starting point for you to start tuning the model.

    return_tree() :
        ->> this method just returns the tree created.

    give_tree(tree) :
        ->> Here you are giving in a tree to this class for it to use. If you understand the general structure of how our
        tree is created you can try to manually try to create a tree (that's not really machine learning though) - but
        most likely you will use this to give the best tree you got from a random forest. There is a give_best_tree method
        in the Random Forest class that will give the best tree created and you can feed that tree you get into this
        model. The Decision Tree will use the tree given by you (unless you call .fit() again)

    visualize_evaluation(y_pred, y_test) :
        ->> y_pred is the predictions (1D)
        ->> y_test is the labels (1D)
        ->> here you get a plot of the predictions and the labels plotted. It can let you know where the model is
        struggling (e.g. predicting a lot of 3s instead of 2s, etc.).
