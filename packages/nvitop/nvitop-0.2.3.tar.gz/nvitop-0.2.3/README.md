An interactive NVIDIA-GPU process viewer.

This project is inspired by [nvidia-htop](https://github.com/peci1/nvidia-htop), a tool for enriching the output of `nvidia-smi`. [nvidia-htop](https://github.com/peci1/nvidia-htop) uses regular expressions to read the output of `nvidia-smi` from a subprocess, which is inefficient. In the meanwhile, there is a powerful interactive GPU monitoring tool called [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop). But [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop) is written in *C*, which makes it lack of portability. And What is really inconvenient is that you should compile it yourself during installation. Therefore, I made this repo. I got a lot help when reading the source code of [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), the console file manager. Some files in this repo are copied and modified from [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) under the GPLv3 License.

This project is currently in the *beta phase*, most features have been tested on Linux. If you are using Windows with CUDA-capable GPUs, please submit feedback on the issue page, thank you very much!

If this repo is useful to you, please star ‚≠êÔ∏è it to let more people know ü§ó.

## Features

- **Informative and fancy output**: show more information than `nvidia-smi` with colorized fancy box drawing.
- **Monitor mode**: can run as a resource monitor, rather than print the results only once. (vs. [nvidia-htop](https://github.com/peci1/nvidia-htop), limited support with command `watch -c`)
- **Interactive**: responsive for user inputs in monitor mode. (vs. [py3nvml](https://github.com/fbcotter/py3nvml))
- **Efficient**:
  - query device status using [*NVML Python bindings*](https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-ml-py) directly and cache them with `ttl_cache` from [cachetools](https://github.com/tkem/cachetools), instead of parsing the output of `nvidia-smi`. (vs. [nvidia-htop](https://github.com/peci1/nvidia-htop))
  - display information using the `curses` library rather than `print` with ANSI escape codes. (vs. [py3nvml](https://github.com/fbcotter/py3nvml))
- **Portable**: work on both Linux and Windows.
  - get host process information using the cross-platform library [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) instead of calling `ps -p <pid>` in a subprocess. (vs. [nvidia-htop](https://github.com/peci1/nvidia-htop) & [py3nvml](https://github.com/fbcotter/py3nvml))
  - written in pure Python, easy to install with `pip`. (vs. [nvtop](https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop))

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)
- nvidia-ml-py
- psutil
- cachetools
- curses
- termcolor

**Note**: The [NVIDIA Management Library (*NVML*)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml) is a C-based programmatic interface for monitoring and managing various states. The runtime version of NVML library ships with the NVIDIA display driver (available at [Download Drivers | NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)), or can be downloaded as part of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (available at [CUDA Toolkit | NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)). The lists of OS platforms and NVIDIA-GPUs supported by the NVML library can be found in the [NVML API Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/nvml-api-reference.html).

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade nvitop
```

Install the latest version from GitHub (*recommended*):

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/XuehaiPan/nvitop.git#egg=nvitop
```

Or, clone this repo and install manually:

```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/XuehaiPan/nvitop.git
$ cd nvitop
$ pip install .
```

## Usage

Query the device and process status. The output is similar to `nvidia-smi`, but has been enriched and colorized.

```bash
# Query status of all devices
$ nvitop

# Specify query devices
$ nvitop -o 0 1  # only show <GPU 0> and <GPU 1>

# Only show devices in `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
$ nvitop -ov
```

Run as a resource monitor, like `htop`:

```bash
# Automatically configure the display mode according to the terminal size
$ nvitop -m

# Arbitrarily display as `full` mode
$ nvitop -m full

# Arbitrarily display as `compact` mode
$ nvitop -m compact

# Specify query devices
$ nvitop -m -o 0 1  # only show <GPU 0> and <GPU 1>

# Only show devices in `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
$ nvitop -m -ov
```

Press `q` to return to the terminal.

Type `nvitop --help` for more information:

```
usage: nvitop [-h] [-m [{auto,full,compact}]] [-o idx [idx ...]] [-ov]
              [--gpu-util-thresh th1 th2] [--mem-util-thresh th1 th2]

A interactive NVIDIA-GPU process viewer.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m [{auto,full,compact}], --monitor [{auto,full,compact}]
                        Run as a resource monitor. Continuously report query data,
                        rather than the default of just once.
                        If no argument is given, the default mode `auto` is used.
  -o idx [idx ...], --only idx [idx ...]
                        Only show the specified devices, suppress option `-ov`.
  -ov, --only-visible   Only show devices in environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
  --gpu-util-thresh th1 th2
                        Thresholds of GPU utilization to distinguish load intensity.
                        Coloring rules: light < th1 % <= moderate < th2 % <= heavy.
                        ( 1 <= th1 < th2 <= 99, defaults: 10 75 )
  --mem-util-thresh th1 th2
                        Thresholds of GPU memory utilization to distinguish load intensity.
                        Coloring rules: light < th1 % <= moderate < th2 % <= heavy.
                        ( 1 <= th1 < th2 <= 99, defaults: 10 80 )
```

#### Keybindings for monitor mode

- `q`: quit and return to the terminal.
- (`<Left>` `<Right>`) / (`[` `]`) / `<S-Wheel>`: scroll the host information of processes.
- `<Home>` / `<C-a>`: scroll the host information of processes to the beginning of line.
- `<End>` / `<C-e>`: scroll the host information of selected processes to the end of line.
- (`<Up>` `<Down>`) / (`<Tab>` `<S-Tab>`) / `<Wheel>`: select and highlight process.
- `<Esc>`: clear selection.
- `T`: send `signal.SIGTERM` to selected process.
- `K`: send `signal.SIGKILL` to selected process.
- `<C-c>`: send `signal.SIGINT` to selected process.

**Note**: Press `CTRL` key to multiply the mouse wheel events by `5`.
