This folder contains functions to convert to and from formats accepted by
third-party libraries. It's expected that this functionality will eventually be
integrated into those third-party libraries, so this folder is likely to be
removed in the future.  Files here have an underscore suffix to avoid clashing
with the imported module (e.g. we 'import msprime' from within msprime_.py).
