Description: # Fast-Layers
        Fast-Layers is a python library for Keras and Tensorflow users: The fastest way to build complex deep neural network architectures with sequential models
        
        
        
        ## Introduction
        Tensorflow's sequential model is a very intuitive way to start learning about Deep Neural Networks.
        However it is quite hard to dive into more complex networks without learning more about Keras.
        
        Well it won't be hard anymore with Fast-layers! Define your Connectors and Pipes to start building complex layers in a sequential fashion.
        
        I create fast-layers for beginners who wants to build more advanced networks and for experimented users who wants to quickly build and test complex module architectures.
