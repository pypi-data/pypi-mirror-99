    mechanism for obtaining race data. It is created using a simple join
    of a race data table and the first names that are input.

    -----
    The manner in which the first name data file was created can be found in
    the "fetch_first_names" Jupyter notebook.

    The first name probability dataframe for this model is generated from the
    `prob_race_given_first_name_harvard.csv` file.
