Bloom provides tools for releasing software on top of a git repository and leverages tools and patterns from git-buildpackage. Additionally, bloom leverages meta and build information from catkin (https://github.com/ros/catkin) to automate release branching and the generation of platform specific source packages, like debian's src-debs.
