Description: # LabTools3
        Set of Python analysis tools for physics labs. It contains the "package" directory which is the Python package with a setup.py script for installation and
        a "doc" directory containing the Sphinx documentation. The repository starts with version 0.2.9 of LabTools.
        Version 1.0.2:  has mostly some big fixes.
        
        Version 1.1.0:  now includes 2D-histograms and some bug fixes.
        
        Version 1.1.1:  includes 3D lego plot for *histo2d*. Note that at the moment surface and lego plots are only in linear scale possible.
        
        Version 1.1.2:  non-linear fitting is now based on *scipy.optimize.least_squares* so parameter bounds can be used.
        
        Version 1.1.3.1:  (same as 1.1.3) updated the *rebin* function for 1D histograms, by default it now returns a new histogram (*replace = False*). Also added the options to have the mean calculated for combined bins instead of the sum (*use_mean = True*). Fixed a bug in *project_x* and *project_y* functions for 2D histograms.
        
        Version 1.1.3.2: minor bug fixes
        
        Version 1.1.3.3: histogram axis labels are preserved in rebinning and projection actions (for 2d histogram)
        
        Version 1.1.3.4: minor bug fixes
