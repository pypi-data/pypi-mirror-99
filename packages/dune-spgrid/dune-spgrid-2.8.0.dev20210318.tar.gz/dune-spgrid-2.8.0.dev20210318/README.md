Dune-SPGrid
===========

The DUNE module dune-spgrid provides a structured, parallel grid: `SPGrid`.


Features
--------

The following table compares the features of SPGrid to those of SGrid and
YaspGrid:

|                                       | `YaspGrid` | `SPGrid` |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------: | :------: |
| Can communicate on codimensions       | all        | all      |
| Coordinate type is template parameter | yes        | yes      |
| Supports anisotropic refinement       | no         | yes      |
| Supports periodic boundary conditions | no[^1]     | yes      |
| Supports non-blocking communication   | no         | yes      |
| Supports tensor-product grids         | yes        | no       |

[^1]: `YaspGrid` supports a different concept of periodicity.

`SPGrid` supports different (global) refinement techniques, selected by a
template parameter. Some refinement techniques allow an optional parameter,
the refinement policy, to be passed to globalRefine.
Currently, isotropic, anisotropic and bisection refinement are supported, but
this list can be extended by downstream modules.
By default, isotropic refinement is used.

If no policy is given, both, isotropic and anisotropic refinement, split each
cube into $2^dim$ child cubes.
For anisotropic refinement, a policy may be used to say which directions
to split.

Bisection refinement always splits a cube into $2$ child cubes; the
split direction can be given by the policy. If no policy is given, the split
directions are cycled through.

*Note*: `SPGrid` does not support tensor-product grids, as `YaspGrid` does.
        This feature can be added by a metagrid layer, if desired.


Preprocessor Magic
------------------

`SPGrid` can be used through the preprocessor magic. The following table shows how
to select different variants of SPGrid:

| GRIDTYPE                    | Refinement                     |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `SPGRID`                    | Default (Isotropic)            |
| `SPGRID_SERIAL`             | Default (Isotropic, no MPI)    |
| `SPGRID_ISOTROPIC`          | Isotropic                      |
| `SPGRID_ISOTROPIC_SERIAL`   | Isotropic (no MPI)             |
| `SPGRID_ANISOTROPIC`        | Anisotropic                    |
| `SPGRID_ANISOTROPIC_SERIAL` | Anisotropic (no MPI)           |
| `SPGRID_BISECTION`          | Bisection                      |
| `SPGRID_BISECTION_SERIAL`   | Bisection (no MPI)             |
| `SPGRID_COUNT_FLOPS`        | use Dune::Fem::Double as ctype |
