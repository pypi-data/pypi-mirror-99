## Introduction

QWeb is an open source web automation interface in [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/). It makes automation **rapid, robust, and fun**.

QWeb aims to make web automation easy and maintainable by:
* providing high level keywords for accessing any web page element
* preferring text locators (UI texts) but supporting also other locator strategies (xpaths, css selectors)
* automatically handling latencies etc. via automatic wait times
* automatically handling unexpected alerts
* minimizing the maintenance effort

See [examples](#examples).

## Requirements
Python **3.6-3.9** and Robot Framework 3.2.2. Browser drivers need to be installed separately.

(Note that support on Mac excludes Apple based silicon (M1), since all dependencies are not yet available for it.)

## Installation

### Windows
```bash
    pip install QWeb
```

### Linux/Mac
```bash
    python3 -m pip install -U pip
    python3 -m pip install QWeb
```


Running the above command installs also supported Selenium and Robot Framework versions + other dependencies, but you still need to install `browser drivers` separately. Please refer to [Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html#drivers) for more information on how to install browser drivers manually OR use 3rd party packages like [WebDriverManager](https://pypi.org/project/webdrivermanager/).

### Examples

#### Basic usage

The preferred way to interact with web elements is using their **text** property. Most elements like input fields and dropdowns can also be found by closest label (text).

```
*** Settings ***
Library    QWeb     # Import library

*** Test Cases ***
Basic interaction
    OpenBrowser         https://qentinelqi.github.io/shop      chrome   # Open chrome and goto given url
    VerifyText          The animal friendly clothing company    # Assert heading text
    ClickText           Scar the Lion   # Click link text
    ClickText           Add to cart     # Click *button* with specific text
    DropDown            Size            Large  # Select value (Large) from dropdown (Size)

```

#### Timeouts and anchors

```
# TIMEOUTS
# By default QWeb tries to locate the element 10 seconds (time can be configured)
ClickText   Sign-in  # Tries to locate and click text "Sign-in" until 10 seconds has passed or until element is found.

# Timeout can be controlled using argument
# Below example re-tries to find element until it's found or 30 seconds has passed. If element is not found after timeout, test will fail.
ClickText   Sign-in     timeout=30  

# ANCHORS
# When multiple elements with same text are found, 
# QWeb can be guided to interact with specific element
# using anchors and indexes

# clicks "Sign-in" text closest to text "Email"
ClickText   Sign-in     anchor=Email   

# clicks the third "Sign-in" on a page
ClickText   Sign-in     index=3
```

#### Other locators

```
# ClickElement
# xpaths and css selectors are supported. 
# Note that equal sign must be escaped
ClickElement    xpath\=//button[@class="my_class"]

# ClickItem
# ClickItem finds element based on any unique attribute,
# in this particular case ALT texts
ClickItem       Increment quantity

```

#### Working with tables

Consider the following table as an example:
![Example table](./images/example_table.png)

```
# First focus on a table using any text in it (column header etc.)
UseTable    Firstname

# Get row number based on content (or last row)
${row}=     GetTableRow     //last                        # returns 5
${row}=     GetTableRow     //last    skip_header=True    # returns 4
...
${row}=     GetTableRow     Jim                           # returns 4
${row}=     GetTableRow     Jim    skip_header=True       # returns 3

# Get value in specific cell
${cell_value}=     GetCellText     r1c2  # Returns "John", first name is column 2.

# Negative numbers as row number will count from the end of table
${cell_value}=     GetCellText     r-1/c2  # Returns "Tina", -1 points to last row
${cell_value}=     GetCellText     r-2/c2  # Returns "Jim", -2 points to second last row
```

#### Changing configuration

```
# QWeb's behavior can be configured with SetConfig keyword

# Highlight all found elements with blue rectangle
SetConfig     SearchMode     Draw

# Set automatic timeout time
SetConfig     DefaultTimeout    60s     # change default/automatic timeout for all keywords
VerifyText    User account created   # Re-tries to find text "User account created" 60 seconds and then fails, if text is not visible
```
