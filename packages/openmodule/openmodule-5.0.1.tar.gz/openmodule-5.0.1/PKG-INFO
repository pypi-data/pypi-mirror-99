        ## Breaking Changes
        
        Breaking changes are annotated [here](docs/migrations.md)
        
        ## Coding Standard
        
        For ARIVO developers we have defined a simple coding standard [here](docs/coding_standard.md)
        
        ## Features
        
        The openmodule package provides a lot of features:
        
        ### Core
        
        The base of the new openmodule, every package should have exactly one. The core handles various things:
        
        * sentry
        * logging
        * dsvgo
        * messaging
        * health
        * alerting
        * database
        
        ``` python
        core = init_openmodule(config, **kwargs)
        shutdown_openmodule()
        ```
        
        #### Messaging
        
        ##### Receiving messages
        
        The core handles message distribution with a dispatcher. You only need to register your callback.
        
        * **register_schema**: Automatically create a schema for your message handler and its models -> Beware that you need to
          document your handler method
        
        ```python
        core.messages.register_handler(b"topic", MessageClass, callback, filter={type = "demo"}, register_schema = True)
        ```
        
        It may also be used together with an event listener to provide further functionality
        
        ```python
        event_listener = EventListener(log=logger)
        core.messages.register_handler(b"topic", MessageClass, event_listener, filter={type = "demo"})
        ...
        event_listener.append(some_function)
        ```
        
        #### Sending messages
        
        It is even easier to send messages
        
        ```python
        message = ZMQMessage(name=core.config.NAME, type="demo")
        core.publish(message, b"topic")
        ```
        
        #### Health
        
        Due to the new convention, the health message should only represent if the service is still alive. This is done
        automatically by the core. If you need to specify some meta data or errors you can pass your handler to the core or set
        it later
        
        ```python
        def healthy() -> HealthResult:
            if error:
                return health_error("we have an error", meta=dict(error="error"))
            return health_ok(meta=dict(this="is_easy"))
        
        
        core = init_openmodule(config, health_handler=healthy)
        # or
        core.health.health_hanlder = healthy
        ```
        
        #### Alerting
        
        The new core also includes an alert handler.
        
        ```python
        core.alerts.send(...)
        alert_id = core.alerts.get_or_add_alert_id(...)
        core.alerts.send_with_alert_id(alert_id, ...)
        ```
        
        #### Database
        
        The openmodule package now also feature a simple database which can be also specified during the template creation. If
        you missed it there, just copy the directory src/database from the template. For more infos see [here](docs/database.md)
        
        ### RPCs
        
        A new RPC server/client was implemented. It works like before and also includes better filtering:
        
        * if a channel is provided for a filter, only rpcs of that channel will be subject to that filter
        * if a type is provided for a filter, only rpcs of that type will be subject to that filter
        * **register_schema**: Automatically create a schema for your rpc and its models -> Beware that you need to document
          your handler method
        
        ```python
        def handler(request: AccessRequest):
        
        
            """
            awesome description
            """
        
        rpc = RPCServer(config=core.config, context=core.context)
        rpc_server.add_filter(self._backend_filter, "backend", "auth")
        rpc_server.register_handler("backend", "auth", request_class=AccessRequest,
                                    response_class=AccessResponse, handler=handler, register_schema=True)
        rpc.run()
        ```
        
        ### Utils
        
        #### Api
        
        We implemented a very basic Api class you can use for http request and that handles errors and authentication. Either
        inherit it or create a class.
        
        ```python
        api = Api(**kwargs)
        try:
            res = api.post("some_url", payload=stuff)
        except ApiException as e:
            if e.retry:  # <- makes sense to try again - timeouts or server not available ...
                ...
        ```
        
        #### Backend
        
        There is also a basic implementation of a backend that provides registration and message passing.
        
        ```python
        class MyBackend(Backend):
            def check_access(self, request: AccessRequest) -> List[Access]:
                ...
        
            def check_in(self, message: CountMessage):
                ...
        
            def check_out(self, message: CountMessage):
                ...
        ```
        
        #### Charset
        
        Useful functions for character manipulation
        
        #### Connection Status
        
        Helper class that checks the connection status of ogclient to our server:
        
        ```python
        connection_status = ConnectionStatusListener(core.messages)
        connection_status.on_connect.append(some_function)
        connection_status.on_disconnect.append(some_function)
        ```
        
        #### Matching
        
        Useful functions for license plate matching
        
        #### Presence
        
        Helper class for listening to presence messages.
        
        ```python
        presence_listener = PresenceListener(core.messages)
        presence_listener.on_enter.append(some_function)
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Openmodule >= 3.0.5 features automatic generation of Rpc and Message Schemas including their models. The generation uses
        data that is generated during the test runs to create an OpenApi Schema. Your RPCs and Message handlers are
        automatically documented if:
        
        * You use the message dispatcher of the core (OpenModuleCoreTestMixin)
        * You use the RPCServer of Openmodule
        
        You can also register models yourself if you want them documented, but you may need to save the Schema in this case:
        
        ```python
        from openmodule.utils.schema import Schema
        
        Schema.save_model(Model)
        Schema.save_rpc(channel, type, request, reqponse, handler)
        Schema.save_message(topic, message_class, handler, filter)
        
        Schema.to_file()
        ```
        
        With default parameters, you need to document your handler functions with a doc string, that is then included as a
        description.
        
        ## Testing
        
        A separate package for testing openmodule packages exists within openmodule - openmodule-test. For more infos
        see [here](docs/testing.md)
