Description: # Adobe Audience Manager - Python Extension
        
        This is a Python wrapper for the Adobe Audience Manager API.
        
        To get started [Generate a JWT Authentication using Adobe IO](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/analytics/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/master/jwt.md)
        
        This package requires you to create a .json document with the following credential details: client ID, client secret, tech account ID, and organization ID. In a separate file, you also need generate a public/private key pair.
        
        credentials.json:
        ```json
        {
            "client_id":"...",
            "client_secret": "...",
            "tech_acct_id": "...",
            "org_id": "..."
        }
        ```
        
        Once you have these documents, you can get install the package and login:
        
        Terminal:
        ```
        pip install adobe_aam
        ```
        
        Python:
        ```py
        import adobe_aam as aam
        aam.Login('path/to/credentials.json', 'path/to/private.key')
        ```
        
        Your authentication token should be tied to a Product Profile, which controls the actions you can execute and the objects on which you can act. If you are unable to perform an action supported by this package, the error is likely due to a permissions issue within the credentials setup.
        
        Here are some examples:
        
        Python:
        ```py
        # Get traits by folder and sort
        aam.Traits.get_many(folderId=12345, sortBy='createTime', descending=True)
        
        # Get trait by sid
        aam.Traits.get_one(sid=12345)
        
        # Get traits by integration code and simplify resulting dataframe
        aam.Traits.get_many(ic='code', condense=True)
        
        # Get trait limits of account
        aam.Traits.get_limits()
        
        # Create traits from csv
        aam.Traits.create_from_csv('path/to/traits_to_create.csv')
        ```
        
        If you're new to Python and want to output the results of an AAM API call, you can try something like the following:
        
        Python:
        ```py
        import pandas as pd
        output = aam.Traits.get_one(sid=12345)
        output.to_csv('path/to/your_aam_output.csv')
        ```
        
        ### Coverage:
        [Every standard API call for AAM can be found on Swagger](https://bank.demdex.com/portal/swagger/index.html#/)

        Custom reporting will be added according to roadmap. Examples:
        
        ```py
        # Get traits trends for all SIDs in a folder
        aam.Reports.traits_trend(startDate="2021-02-21",
                                 endDate="2021-02-23",
                                 folderId=12345)
                                 
        # Get traits trends for one SID
        aam.Reports.traits_trend(startDate="2021-02-21",
                                 endDate="2021-02-23",
                                 sid=[12345])
        ```
