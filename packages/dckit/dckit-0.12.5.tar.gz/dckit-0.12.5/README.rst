**DCKit** is a graphical toolkit for performing several data editing
tasks that would otherwise be only available via the
`dclab command-line interface <https://dclab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sec_cli.html>`__
or (for the .rtdc file format) via external tools such as
`HDFView <https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/>`__.


Installation
------------
A Windows installer and macOS packages are available from the
`release page <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/DCKit/releases>`__.
If you have Python 3 installed, you may also use pip to install DCKit:
::

    # install dckit
    pip install dckit
    # run dckit
    dckit


Usage
-----
The interface is mostly self-explanatory. Add measurements via the options
in the ``File`` menu or by drag-and-dropping files into DCKit. You may edit
entries in the ``Sample`` column and apply the changes via the
``Update sample names`` button on the right.


Testing
-------

::

    pip install -e .
    python -m pytest tests
