# ToDo Decide what to do with the universal single quote, which is also the apostrophe (many false positives) [For now: removed]
# ToDo Decide what to do with quotation dash (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Quotation_dash)

# Note on code design: for now there is one non-trivial matching of quotes, for the single quote/apostrophe
# (which is based on a more complex check also incorporating the characters before and after, to differentiate
# apostrophe usage from single quote usage)
# This has been solved ad hoc.
# It could be solved nicely by defining a quote as a regex (containing look-ahead and look-behind functionality),
# and matching regexes instead of characters.
# However, this is overkill unless there is a more compelling need than for the signel apostrophe/quotation mark
