Description: # EPySeg
        
        **EPySeg is a package for segmenting 2D epithelial tissues.** EPySeg also ships with a graphical user interface that allows for building, training and running deep learning models. Training can be done with or without data augmentation (2D-xy and 3D-xyz data augmentation arejust  supported). EPySeg relies on the [segmentation_models](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models) library. EPySeg source code is available [here](https://github.com/baigouy/EPySeg). Cloud version available [here](https://github.com/baigouy/notebooks).
