        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install webpty.
        
        ```bash
        pip install webpty
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        webpty
        ```
        
        This creates a tornado server which will be serving your bash shell on http://localhost:8000/
        
        ### Change Shell
        
        ```bash
        webpty -c $SHELL
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        webpty --cmd=$SHELL
        
        ```
        
        This $SHELL can be anything like bash, sh, python, vim, etc. which is present in the system.
        
        ### Change Port
        
        ```bash
        webpty -p $PORT
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        webpty --port=$PORT
        
        ```
        
        This creates a tornado server which will be serving your bash shell on http://localhost:$PORT/
        
        
        ### Change Allowed Hosts
        
        By default, the server will accept request from all the hosts without any restriction, to
        make it accept only from certain hosts
        
        ```bash
        webpty -ah $ALLOWED_HOSTS
        ```
        or
        ```bash
        webpty --allowed-hosts=$ALLOWED_HOSTS
        ```
        This creates a tornado server which  allows only requests from $ALLOWED_HOSTS.
        
        This $ALLOWED_HOSTS should be list of strings seperated by a comma.
