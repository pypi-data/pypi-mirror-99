Description: # An Algorithm to Compute Locally Optimal Paths for Large-Scale Traffic Models
        
        This package provides an implementation of the algorithm REVC to compute
        locally optimal routes between many origins and destinations, as described 
        by [Fischer et al. (2020)][REF]. If you use this package 
        in research that leads to a scientific publication, we kindly ask you to 
        cite the publication.
        
        The package is licensed under the [LGPL-v3][LGPL]. For documentation please refer to
        [the project's documentation page on github][DOC]. Please report any bugs on 
        [the project's bug tracker][BUG]. You are welcome to adjust the provided
        files to your needs and to improve the code. It is encouraged that you share any 
        improvements on [the github page][GIT] if possible.
