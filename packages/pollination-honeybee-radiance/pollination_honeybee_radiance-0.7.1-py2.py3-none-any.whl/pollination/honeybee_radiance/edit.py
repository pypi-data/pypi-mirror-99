    This involves setting the direction of every sensor to point up (0, 0, 1) and

    point downward. In thermal mapping workflows, the upward-pointing grids are
    used to account for direct and diffuse shortwave irradiance while the
    downard pointing grids account for ground-reflected shortwave irradiance.
