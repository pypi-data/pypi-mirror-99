.SH NAME
rpl \- replace strings in files
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: rpl [\-h] [\-\-version] [\-\-encoding ENCODING] [\-E] [\-i] [\-m] [\-w] [\-b] [\-q] [\-v] [\-s] [\-e] [\-F] [\-\-files] [\-\-noglob] [\-p] [\-f] [\-d] OLD\-TEXT NEW\-TEXT [FILE [FILE ...]]
.PP
Search and replace text in files.
.PP
Text matching the pattern \fIOLD-TEXT\fR is replaced by \fINEW-TEXT\fR in each \fIFILE\fR.

Filenames may include glob patterns (these must be quoted to
avoid being interpreted by the shell), and in particular may use ‘\fI**\fR’ to
match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. Tilde and
environment variable expansion is also performed.
