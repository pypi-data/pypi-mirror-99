class DependencyResolver(IReconfigurable, IReferenceable):
    """
    Helper class for resolving component dependencies.
    The resolver is configured to resolve named dependencies by specific locator.
    During deployment the dependency locator can be changed.

    This mechanism can be used to clarify specific dependency among several alternatives.
    Typically components are configured to retrieve the first dependency that matches
    logical group, type and version. But if container contains more than one instance
    and resolution has to be specific about those instances, they can be given a unique
    name and dependency resolvers can be reconfigured to retrieve dependencies by their name.

    ### Configuration parameters ###
    dependencies:
        - [dependency name 1]: Dependency 1 locator (descriptor)
        - ...
        - [dependency name N]: Dependency N locator (descriptor)
    References:
        - References must match configured dependencies.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyComponent(IConfigurable, IReferenceable):
            _dependencyResolver = None
            _persistence = None

                self._dependencyResolver.setReferences(references)
                self._persistence = self._dependencyResolver.get_one_required("persistence")
