    Inversion of control design pattern. There exist various implementations,
    a popular one being "inversion of dependency". Requires introspection and
    is implemented differently in different languages. In PipServices, the "location
    design pattern‚Äù is used, which is much simpler than dependency injection and is
    a simple implementation, that is portable between languages. Used for building
    various containers, as well as testing objects.
