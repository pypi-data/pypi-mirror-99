class ObjectWriter:
    """
    Helper class to perform property introspection and dynamic writing.

    In contrast to :class:`PropertyReflector <pip_services3_commons.reflect.PropertyReflector.PropertyReflector>` which only introspects regular objects,
    this ObjectWriter is also able to handle maps and arrays.
    For maps properties are key-pairs identified by string keys,
    For arrays properties are elements identified by integer index.

    This class has symmetric implementation across all languages supported
    by Pip.Services toolkit and used to support dynamic data processing.

    Because all languages have different casing and case sensitivity rules,
    this ObjectWriter treats all property names as case insensitive.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        myObj = MyObject()

        ObjectWriter.set_property(myObj, "myProperty", 123)
        myMap = { key1: 123, key2: "ABC" }
        ObjectWriter.set_property(myMap, "key1", "XYZ")

        myArray = [1, 2, 3]
        ObjectWriter.set_property(myArray, "0", 123)

        The object can be a user defined object, map or array.
        The property name correspondently must be object property, map key or array index.

        If the property does not exist or introspection fails
        this method doesn't do anything and doesn't any throw errors.
