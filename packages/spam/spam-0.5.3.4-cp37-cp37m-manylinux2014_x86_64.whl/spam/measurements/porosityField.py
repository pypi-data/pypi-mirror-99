    """
    This function calculates a porosity field on a greyscale image, outputting a field in % porosity.
    A list of half-window sizes can be given, allowing for porosity measurement stability to to evaluate easily.

    Parameters
    ----------
        image : 3D numpy array

        poreValue : float
            The grey value corresponding to the peak of the pores.
            Grey values of this value as considered 100% pore.
            In the case of 2 peaks in the pores (having water and air), should put the principal one.

        solidValue : float
            The grey value corresponding to the peak of the solids.
            Grey values of this value as considered 100% solid.

        maskValue : float, optional
            Indicate whether there is a special value in the input image
            that corrseponds to a mask which indicates voxels that are not taken
            into account in the porosity calculation.
            Default = None

        hws : int or list, optional
            half-window size for cubic measurement window
            Default = 10

        nodeSpacing : int, optional
            spacing of nodes in pixels
            Default = 10 pixels

        showGraph : bool, optional
            If a list of hws is input, show a graph of the porosity evolution
            Default = False

    Returns
    -------
        3D (or 4D) numpy array for constant half-window size (list of half-window sizes)
