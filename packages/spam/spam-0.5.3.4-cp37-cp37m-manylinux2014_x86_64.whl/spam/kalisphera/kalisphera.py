    This function creates a sphere in a given 3D volume,

    have a greyvalue of 1.

    Greyvalues are added to the volume, so spheres can be
    added to an existing background.

    This function creates a sphere or series of spheres in a 3D volume,

    Parameters
    ----------

            Dimensions of volume to create

        blur : float, optional

            Default = 0

        noise : float, optional
            Standard devitaion of the noise (in greylevels), noise is on the scale: background=0 and sphere=1
            Default = 0

        flatten : bool, optional
            Flatten greyvalues >1 to 1 (caused by overlaps)?

        foreground : float, optional
