Summary: # About GridCal

GridCal is a research oriented power systems software.

Research oriented? How? Well, it is a fruit of research. It is designed to be modular.
As a researcher I found that the available software (not even talking about commercial
options) are hard to expand or adapt to achieve complex simulations. GridCal is
designed to allow you to build and reuse modules, which eventually will boost your
productivity and the possibilities that are at hand.

So, I do really hope you enjoy it, and if you have comments, suggestions or just want
to collaborate, do not hesitate to contact.

Cheers,
Santiago
