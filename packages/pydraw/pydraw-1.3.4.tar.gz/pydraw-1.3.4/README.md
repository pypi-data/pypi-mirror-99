![version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pydraw)

This is a simple graphics library designed to make graphics
and input simple and synchronized.

It was originally designed to replace turtle as the goto graphics library for teaching
computer science. It has grown into a larger project, with loftier goals of creating an 
easy-to-use library that will be easy to learn, teach, and use in almost any circumstance.

## Getting Started

### Recommended
In order to install pydraw, you can use Python's default dependency repository, 
[pypi](https://pypi.org) by running the command `pip install pydraw` in the terminal.

### Other Options

You can also install pydraw by downloading a release file, `pydraw.py` from the 
[releases](https://github.com/pydraw/pydraw), and placing the file in your project's
directory.


#### After installation, you can import the library with: `from pydraw import *`.

## Basic Setup

---
After importing pydraw, you can write a basic skeleton program like so:

```python
from pydraw import *

screen = Screen(800, 600, 'My First Project!')  # creates a screen to draw on

fps = 30
running = True
while running:
    screen.update()  # We want to update the screen if we make any changes!
    screen.sleep(1 / fps)  # Limit our updates by a certain time delay, in this case 30fps
                                       # The argument is the delay in milliseconds

screen.exit()  # Must be called at the end of a pydraw program
```

We can create our first object with just one new line:
```python
from pydraw import *

screen = Screen(800, 600, 'My First Project!')

# Here we create a rectangle at x=50, y=50 that is 50 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall.
# It is top-left anchored. This means that the position is the location of the top left corner.
# It's important to know that pydraw's canvas has the origin in the top left, with
# positive-y at the bottom of the screen, and positive-x to the right of the screen.
box = Rectangle(screen, 50, 50, 50, 50) 

fps = 30
running = True
while running:
    screen.update()
    screen.sleep(1 / fps)

screen.exit()
```


‚≠ê And getting straight to the point, one of pydraw's primary features is incredibly easy user-input detection.
```python
from pydraw import *

screen = Screen(800, 600, 'My First Project!')

box = Rectangle(screen, 50, 50, 50, 50) 

def mousedown(button, location):
  print(f'Wow, the {button}-button on the mouse!')

def mouseup(button, location):
  print('How un-impressive...')

def keydown(key):
  print(f'Keyboard input is {key} to creating interactive programs!')

def keyup(key):
  print('For when you really just gotta stop moving, keyup is here to save you.')

# All of the above methods must be defined above this statement (because Python):
screen.listen()


# -- As you can see, user input is as simple as defining methods and telling pydraw to listen!
#    This feature has been long overdue for teachers who want to teach Python to their students
#    by making really cool stuff but can't escape how ridiculously input has been handled in the past.
#    Now defining user input is easy to understand and use.

fps = 30
running = True
while running:
    screen.update()
    screen.sleep(1 / fps)

screen.exit()
```

This library supports many modifiers and methods for almost all objects:
```python
# ... code above

box = Rectangle(screen, 50, 50, 50, 50)  # Remember this is (x, y, width, height)!
box.x(box.y())  # set the box's x coordinate to its y coordinate
                # notice how you can access the coordinates or change them with methods.

box.location()  # We can get the Location like this!

box.move(-5, 100)  # move the box by -5 on the x-axis, 100 on the y.
box.moveto(screen.width() / 2, screen.height() / 2)  # move to near the center of the screen

box.width(box.height())  # set the box's width to its height
                         # again, it's important to notice the methods are dual-purpose

box.color(Color('red'))  # let's change the color to red
                         # it's helpful to know that the screen's color is white by default
                         # but, it can be changed with: "screen.color()"

box.border(Color('black'), fill=False)  # now we give the box a black border.
                                        # And we can make it a framed rectangle by setting fill=False

box.rotate(14)  # rotate our box by 14 degrees, clockwise
box.rotation(box.rotation() + 14)  # this is the same as the above line with the rotation method

box.visible(False)  # Hide our box. It is not visible
                    # We can also get the visibility-state by not passing anything

box.remove()  # Just get rid of that old box. We can make a better one soon :)

# code below ...
```

Lastly we can create some other objects and interact with them:

(It's important to note that all the Renderables below can use the methods listed 
above (including `overlaps()` and `contains()`, which we see in the excerpt below) 
except the CustomRenderables: CustomPolygon and Image, which are only supported for
a few.)
```python
# ... code above

not_a_box = Oval(screen, 400, 50, 100, 100, Color('magenta'))  # now we have a beautiful oval
almost_a_box = Triangle(screen, 200, 450, 100, 50, Color('yellow'), rotation=30) # uno dos tres
# ^ Also note that we are setting the color, and also setting the rotation of the triangle,
# but the other parameters are still in the usual format: (x, y, width, height).
# IMPORTANT: Triangle's base is on the left, with the triangle's location as its top corner.

# We can create a regular polygon by specifying a number of sides before the location.
# The constructor is (screen, num_sides, x, y, width, height)!
schrodingers_box = Polygon(screen, 5, 250, 150, 50, 50, border=Color('red'))
# Polygon, like Triangle, will also try to put a vertex as close to the top left as possible,
# so usually you will end up with the base of the polygon at the top.

# We can create an evil polygon like this (we can pass in a list of locations or tuples):
weird_evil_box = CustomPolygon(screen, [(500, 50), (550, 50), (550, 100), (500, 50)])
# ^ The real term for these is "Irregular Polygons". But irregular is hard to type so here we are.


# We can interact with these objects with these methods:
not_a_box.overlaps(almost_a_box)  # Do these objects overlap?
weird_evil_box.contains(Location(525, 75))  # Is this point inside the shape?

schrodingers_box.distance(not_a_box)  # Gets the precise distance between the centers

# code below ...
```

### Text, Images, and Lines

pyDraw has specific APIs for Text, Images, and Lines that will sometimes deviate from the 
standard methods slightly.

#### Text
```python
# ... code above

text = Text(screen, 'Some Cool Text!', screen.width(), screen.height(), Color('purple'))
text.move(-text.width() / 2, -text.height() / 2)  # You can get the width and height to perfectly center
                                                  # any text easily!
text.font('Calibri')
text.rotate(45)  # You can still rotate text if you want :)

text.bold(True)
text.underline(True)
text.strikethrough(False)

# code below ...
```

#### Images
```python
# ... code above

image = Image(screen, 'image.png', screen.width() / 3, screen.height() / 3)
# ^ We can load an image like this, and it will display on teh screen
# Note that we cannot add a size or color without having PIL installed, which will be installed 
# on the system if pydraw is installed via 'pip install pydraw'. If you use the file version of 
# pydraw, 'pydraw.py', you must also install PIL onto the system in order to manipulate images via:
# 'pip install pillow' (Pillow is the fork of PIL, still maintained to this day).

# Now that we know we have PIL installed we can have some fun
image.width(150)
image.height(150)

image.rotate(5)

image.color(Color('red'), alpha=123)
# ^ This will tint the image with a red color, at an alpha level of 123 (default).
# If you increase the alpha, the image will become less visible and the tint-color more so,
# and vice versa.

# code below ...
```

#### Lines
```python
# ... code above

# Let's create a nice line that goes across the screen with a beautiful blue color.
line = Line(screen, 150, 150, screen.width() - 50, screen.height() - 50, color = Color('blue'))

# We can modify the line's thickness:
line.thickness(5)

# We can even rotate the line!
line.rotate(35, point=1)  # Note that here we are specifying which point to rotate AROUND!

# We can use a special feature of lines to make them point at stuff!
line.lookat(another_location)  # SUPER NIFTY!

# code below ...
```

## API/Docs
The documentation for [pydraw](https://pypi.org/project/pydraw) wis available at the main website: https://pydraw.graphics
The documentation is shipped with the package so code completion and method descriptors are
available for supporting IDEs.

## DIY
If you want to build your own version of pydraw, just fork this repository and run 
`python -m build` in the terminal. You should get a release/ directory with a pydraw.py held
dearly within it. (As well as a `pydraw.py` file in the `compiled/` directory!)
