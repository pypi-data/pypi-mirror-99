# pybuilder-anybadge #

A pybuilder plugin that generates badges for your project using `anybadge`, for more information refer to the [anybadge pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/anybadge/).

To add this plugin into your pybuilder project, add the following line near the top of your build.py:
```python
use_plugin('pypi:pybuilder_anybadge')
```

**NOTE** if you are using Pybuilder version `v0.11.x`, then specify the following version of the plugin:
```python
use_plugin('pypi:pybuilder_anybadge', '~=0.1.4')
```

### Pybuilder anybadge properties ###

The pybuilder task `pyb anybadge` will use anybadge to generate badges for your project by processing reports produced from various plugins; the badges that are currently supported are:
- **complexity** - requires the [pybuilder_radon](https://pypi.org/project/pybuilder-radon/) plugin. Generate badge using cyclomatic complexity score of your most complicated function.
- **severity** - requires the [pybuilder_bandit](https://pypi.org/project/pybuilder-bandit/) plugin. Generate badge using number of security vulnerabilities discovered by severity.
- **coverage** - requires the `coverage` plugin. Generate badge for overall unit test coverage.
- **python** - Generate badge for version of Python being used

The plugin will write the respective badges to the `docs/images` folder. The following plugin properties are available to further configure badge generation.

Name | Type | Default Value | Description
-- | -- | -- | --
anybadge_exclude | str | '' | Comma delimited string of badges to exclude from processing, valid values are 'complexity', 'severity', 'coverage' and 'python'
anybadge_add_to_readme | bool | False | Specify if plugin should add badges to the README.md file (see below for example). **Note** the plugin will add the badge references but you must commit/push the changes (including svg files in the docs/images folder)
anybadge_complexity_use_average | bool | False | Use overall average complexity as score when generating complexity badge

The plugin properties are set using `project.set_property`, the following is an example of how to set the properties:

```Python
project.set_property('anybadge_exclude', 'severity,coverage')
project.set_property('anybadge_add_to_readme', True)
project.set_property('anybadge_complexity_use_average', True)
```

The following badges were generated for this project using the `pybuilder_anybadge` plugin:
