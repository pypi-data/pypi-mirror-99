1.4.0
=====

- Surface will interpolate data at 0.3 m if the provided data is spaced too
  coarsely.
- Support Dash > 4.0.
- Added a "download for analysis" button to the design page, so that the
  downloaded file can be uploaded into the analysis page.
- Various visual design improvements to the app.
- Negative takeoff angles are now supported in the app (up to -20 degrees).
- Removed the fastcache dependency.
- Added a set of conda environment.yml files for development and deployment.
- Improved the layout of the home page on the web app.
- Improved the app performance by using the newer Dash multiple output
  functionality instead of a hidden data store.
- The app now displays animated dots under the graph while it is computing to
  give some feedback to the user.
- Added support to upload data files of distance vs angle measurements in
  addition to Cartesian coordinates in the app.
- Added a new function to compute a surface's Cartesian coordinates given
  measures of distance along the surface and absolute angle along the surface.
- Minimum Python supported is now 3.6 (dropped support for 3.5 and added
  support for 3.8).
- Moved web application module into the skijumpdesign package.
- Added a new page in the web application for analyzing measured jumps.
- Added documentation demonstrating the use of calcualte_efh() on a number of
  measured jumps.
- Added a new function for computing the equivalent fall height of a surface
  given the takeoff point, takeoff angle, and surface shape and a function for
  generating EFH plots.

  file is not present due to setuptools limitations in locating the css file.
- Adjusted the characteristic distance in the landing transition to match the
  Matlab code.

1.1.2
