# Getting Started with APIMATIC Calculator

## Getting Started

### Introduction

Simple calculator API hosted on APIMATIC

### Install the Package

The package is compatible with Python versions `2 >=2.7.9` and `3 >=3.4`.
Install the package from PyPi using the following pip command:

```python
pip install apimaticcalculatortest1==1.0.0
```

You can also view the package at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apimaticcalculatortest1

### Initialize the API Client

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `environment` | Environment | The API environment. <br> **Default: `Environment.PRODUCTION`** |
| `timeout` | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| `max_retries` | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 3** |
| `backoff_factor` | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 0** |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```python
from apimaticcalculator.apimaticcalculator_client import ApimaticcalculatorClient
from apimaticcalculator.configuration import Environment

client = ApimaticcalculatorClient(
    environment = Environment.PRODUCTION,)
```

### Test the SDK

You can test the generated SDK and the server with test cases. `unittest` is used as the testing framework and `nose` is used as the test runner. You can run the tests as follows:

Navigate to the root directory of the SDK and run the following commands

```
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
nosetests
```

## Client Class Documentation

### APIMATIC Calculator Client

The gateway for the SDK. This class acts as a factory for the Controllers and also holds the configuration of the SDK.

### Controllers

| Name | Description |
|  --- | --- |
| simple_calculator | Gets SimpleCalculatorController |

## API Reference

### List of APIs

* [Simple Calculator](#simple-calculator)

### Simple Calculator

#### Overview

##### Get instance

An instance of the `SimpleCalculatorController` class can be accessed from the API Client.

```
simple_calculator_controller = client.simple_calculator
```

#### Get Calculate

Calculates the expression using the specified operation.

:information_source: **Note** This endpoint does not require authentication.

```python
def get_calculate(self,
                 options=dict())
```

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operation` | [`OperationTypeEnum`](#operation-type) | Template, Required | The operator to apply on the variables |
| `x` | `float` | Query, Required | The LHS value |
| `y` | `float` | Query, Required | The RHS value |

##### Response Type

`float`

##### Example Usage

```python
collect = {}
operation = OperationTypeEnum.MULTIPLY
collect['operation'] = operation

x = 222.14
collect['x'] = x

y = 165.14
collect['y'] = y

result = simple_calculator_controller.get_calculate(collect)
```
