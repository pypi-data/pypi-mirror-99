        GraphDot is a GPU-accelerated Python library that carries out graph dot product operations to compute graph similarity. Currently, the library implements the Marginalized Graph Kernel algorithm, which uses a random walk process to compare subtree patterns and thus defining a generalized graph convolution process. The library can operate on undirected graphs, either weighted or unweighted, that contain arbitrary nodal and edge labels and attributes. It implements state-of-the-art GPU acceleration algorithms and supports versatile customization through just-in-time code generation and compilation.
