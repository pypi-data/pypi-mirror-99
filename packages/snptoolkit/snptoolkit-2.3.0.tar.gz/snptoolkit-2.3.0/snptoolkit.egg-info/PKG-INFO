                                snpToolkit is a computational framework written in Python 3. snpToolkit allows users to:
                                - Visualize the content of their VCF files.
                                - Filter SNPs based on multiple criteria.
                                - Extract the distribution of all indels according to genome annotation.
                                - Visualize and explore the annotated SNPs for all analyzed files.
                                - Combine all snpToolkit output files generated using the annotate option.
                                - Analyse your data using two dimentionality reduction methods: PCA and UMAP.
                                snpToolkit detects automatically if the input vcf files were generated using samtools mpileup, gatk HaplotypeCaller or freebayes. Vcf files could be gzipped or not.
