Description: orbithunter 0.5rc1
        ==================
        orbithunter serves as a framework for solving chaotic nonlinear partial differential equations.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - An object oriented approach to solutions of partial differential equations
        - A general-purpose framework for finding, visualizing and manipulating these solutions
        - High-level access to SciPy API, particularly its minimize and optimize packages.
        - New spatiotemporal techniques such as 'clipping' and 'gluing'
        
        Currently there is only an implementation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE).
