class Channel(BasicObject):
    """
    A channel is a sequence of measured or computed samples that are indexed
    against some physical quantity e.g. depth or time. The standard supports
    multi-dimensional samples. Each sample can be a scalar or a n-dimensional
    array. In addition to giving access to the actual curve-data, the Channel
    object contains metadata about the curve.

    All Channels are a part of one, and only one, Frame. The parent Frame can
    be reached directly through :py:attr:`frame`.

    Refer to the :py:func:`curves` to see some examples on how to access the
    curve-data.

    Attributes
    ----------

    long_name : str or Longname
        Descriptive name of the channel.

    reprc : int
        Representation code

    units : str
        Physical units of each element in the channel's sample arrays

    properties : list(str)
        Property indicators that summarizes the characteristics of the
        channel and the processing that have produced it.

    dimension : list(int)
        Dimensions of the samples

    axis : list(Axis)
        Coordinate axes of the samples

    element_limit : list(int)
        The maximum size of the sample dimensions

    source
        The source of the channel. Returns the source object, if any

    frame : Frame
        Frame to which channel belongs to

    Notes
    -----

    The Channel object reflects the logical record type CHANNEL, defined in
    rp66. CHANNEL records are listed in Appendix A.2 - Logical Record Types and
    described in detail in Chapter 5.5.1 - Static and Frame Data, CHANNEL
    objects.

        Frame.curves() : Read all the curves in a Frame in one go

        Notes
        -----

        This method should only be used if there is only *one* channel of
        interest in a particular frame.

        Due to the memory-layout of dlis-files, reading a single channel from
        disk and reading the entire frame is almost equally fast. That means
        reading channels from the same frame one-by-one with this method is
        _way_ slower than reading the entire frame with :func:`Frame.curves()`
        and then indexing on the channels-of-interest.

        Examples
        --------

        Read the full curve

        >>> curve = channel.curves()
        >>> curve
        array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4])

        The returned array supports common slicing operations

        >>> curve[::2]
        array([1.1, 3.3])

        Read the full curve from a multidimensional channel

        >>> curve = multichannel.curves()
        >>> curve
        array([[[  1,  2,  3],
                [  4,  5,  6]],
               [[  7,  8,  9],
                [ 10, 11,  12]]])

        This curve has two samples, that both are of size 2x3. From the 1st
        sample, read the element located in the 2nd row, 3rd column
