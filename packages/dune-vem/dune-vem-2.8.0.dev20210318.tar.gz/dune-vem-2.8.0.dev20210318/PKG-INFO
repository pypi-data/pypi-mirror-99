Description: Preparing the Sources
        =========================
        
        Additional to the software mentioned in README you'll need the
        following programs installed on your system:
        
          cmake >= 3.13.3
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        If these preliminaries are met, you should run
        
          dunecontrol all
        
        which will find all installed dune modules as well as all dune modules
        (not installed) which sources reside in a subdirectory of the current
        directory. Note that if dune is not installed properly you will either
        have to add the directory where the dunecontrol script resides (probably
        ./dune-common/bin) to your path or specify the relative path of the script.
        
        Most probably you'll have to provide additional information to dunecontrol
        (e. g. compilers, configure options) and/or make options.
        
        The most convenient way is to use options files in this case. The files
        define four variables:
        
        CMAKE_FLAGS      flags passed to cmake (durin configure)
        MAKE_FLAGS       flags passed to make
        
        An example options file might look like this:
        
        #use this options to autogen, configure and make if no other options are given
        CMAKE_FLAGS=" \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-4.9 \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-Wall -pedantic' \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path" #Force g++-4.9 and set compiler flags
        MAKE_FLAGS=install #Per default run make install instead of simply make
        
        If you save this information into example.opts you can pass the opts file to
        dunecontrol via the --opts option, e. g.
        
          dunecontrol --opts=example.opts all
        
        More info
        ---------
        
        See
        
             dunecontrol --help
        
        for further options.
        
        
        The full build-system is described in the dune-common/doc/buildsystem (Git version) or under share/doc/dune-common/buildsystem if you installed DUNE!
