=====================================================
[![Build](https://github.com/edmundsj/liapy/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/edmundsj/liapy/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml) [![docs](https://github.com/edmundsj/liapy/actions/workflows/build-docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/edmundsj/liapy/actions/workflows/build-docs.yml) 
I wrote this to be a python-based lock-in amplifier for some measurements I was
doing in the course of my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. Documentation, including an
API, can be found [here](https://edmundsj.github.io/LockInAmplifier/)
