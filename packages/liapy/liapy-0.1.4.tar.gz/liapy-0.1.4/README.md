LockInAmplifier - A python-based Lock-in Amplifier
=====================================================
I wrote this to be a python-based lock-in amplifier for some measurements I was
doing in the course of my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. Documentation, including an
API, can be found [here](https://edmundsj.github.io/LockInAmplifier/)
