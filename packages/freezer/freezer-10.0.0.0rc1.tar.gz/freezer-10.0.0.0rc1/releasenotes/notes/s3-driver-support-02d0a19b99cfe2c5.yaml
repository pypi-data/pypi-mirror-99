    Currently, freezer can only store backup data to swift compatible object
    storage (except local and ssh), so we should increase support for other
    storage driver. S3 compatible object storage is a valid choice, which is
    used by many individuals and companies in the public or private clouds.

    Added new storage type called 's3' which allows to store the backup data
    to S3 compatible object storage and restore from it with using botocore
    library.
