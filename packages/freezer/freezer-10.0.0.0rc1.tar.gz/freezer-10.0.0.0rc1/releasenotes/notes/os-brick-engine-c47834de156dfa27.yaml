    Currently Freezer provides basic features to execute Cinder volumes backup.
    The current approach present significant challenges,
    due mainly to the difficulty of downloading Cinder Volumes without passing
    through Glance. This can be an issue for time and scalability reasons,
    (i.e. volumes of few hundreds GB size, potential error probability increase,
    as more services are part of the process, unailability of cinder-backup).

features:
  - |
    Added new backup engine called 'os-brick' which allows to backup and
    restore the content of  cinder volumes attaching it directly to localhost
    using functionality of os-brick library.

issues:
  - |
    There are could be a read/write file permisson issues if freezer-agent
    don't have appropriate right to read\write files to mounted FS.
