    Currently, when using 'freezer-agent --action backup --engine nova
    --nova-inst-id xxx --mode nova --no-incremental true' to backup instance
    that boot from volume or snapshot, it gives us the result of successful
    backup. But when we restore the nova instance from the backup data and
    launch the restored instance, it will fail with 'no boot device error'
    message. This can be an issue.

    With the above issue, freezer can not support the backup and restore of
    instance that boot from volume or snapshot correctly. With this fix, when
    using backup, freezer will create an image from the volume, and then
    store the image data to storage media. After this fix, users can backup
    and restore the nova instance no matter what type of the instance is.
