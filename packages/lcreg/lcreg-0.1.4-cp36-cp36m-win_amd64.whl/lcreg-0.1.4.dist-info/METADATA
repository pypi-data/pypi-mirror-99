# *lcreg* - Efficient registration of large 3D images 

Rigid and affine registration of large scalar 3D images is an import step for both medical and non-medical image processing. The distinguishing feature of *lcreg* is its capability to efficiently register images that do not fit into system memory. *lcreg* is based on the optimisation of the local correlation similarity measure [1] using a novel image encoding scheme fostering on-the-fly image compression and decompression [2].

# Tutorial and samples
The *lcreg tutorial* provides a step by step guide for the installation and practical application of the software and is complemented by sample data and configuration files (156 MB). These ressources can be downloaded from [here](https://cloud.hs-augsburg.de/index.php/s/iR8BBZM2n6zcxSp).
