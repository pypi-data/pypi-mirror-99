        ## Getting started
        First of all, create a new repository from this [![template][B1]][A1] \
        Name it accordingly and place where it best fits for your team.

        [A1]: https://github.com/generic-tree/root/generate "Github repository's template generation URL"
        
        ### Development environment
        Make sure you have `Git` installed:
        ```bash
        $ git --version
        git version 2.25.1
        ```
        
        Thus, clone the recent-created repository locally
        and you'll be ready to start developing your project. 
        
        ### Repo publication
        After all, you should make this project your own: \
        Write a good README to present your project to the world. \
        And also ensure to tailor the project license to your needs.
