    Mechanism to use for key agreement.

    Enumeration values::
        AgreeKeyMechanism.HELLMAN = "diffie_hellman"

    This class doesnt use python standard enumeration since they dont support unknown values. 
    
    This is an object of type BaseEnumObject and provides similar functionality as a String Enumeration.
    
    Get a standard instance of enum: AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO or AgreeKeyMechanism("FOO")
    Get non standard instance of enum: AgreeKeyMechanism("BAR")
    Enum instance to String value: AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO.value , AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO.name (Gives "FOO")
    Equality: AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO == AgreeKeyMechanism("FOO") , AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO != AgreeKeyMechanism.BAR
    Provides str func:  str(AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO) == "AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO"
    
    Also the class maintains a static dict of values. hence AgreeKeyMechanism.FOO and AgreeKeyMechanism("FOO") are really backed by same data.
