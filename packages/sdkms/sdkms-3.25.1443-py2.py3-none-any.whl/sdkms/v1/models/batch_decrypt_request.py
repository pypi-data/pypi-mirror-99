    This class BatchDecryptRequest denotes list of BatchDecryptRequestInner
    In python subclassing a list is not recommended, hence this class stores the list of BatchDecryptRequestInner as its parameter.

    Initialize object: batch_decrypt_request = BatchDecryptRequest()
    Add object to BatchDecryptRequest object: batch_decrypt_request.append(BatchDecryptRequestInner())
    Insert object to BatchDecryptRequest object at index: batch_decrypt_request.insert(1, BatchDecryptRequestInner())
    Delete an object from BatchDecryptRequest object at index: batch_decrypt_request.remove(1)
    Get the list of BatchDecryptRequestInner: list()
