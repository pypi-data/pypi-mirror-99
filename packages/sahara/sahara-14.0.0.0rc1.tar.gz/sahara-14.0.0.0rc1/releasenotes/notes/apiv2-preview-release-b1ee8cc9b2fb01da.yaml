    Sahara's APIv2 is now exposed by default (although its state is
    still experimental). It has feature parity with Sahara's APIv1.1,
    but APIv2 brings better REST semantics, tweaks to some response
    payloads, and some other improvements. APIv2 will remain labeled
    experimental until it is stabilized following the addition of new
    features to it in the coming cycle(s).
