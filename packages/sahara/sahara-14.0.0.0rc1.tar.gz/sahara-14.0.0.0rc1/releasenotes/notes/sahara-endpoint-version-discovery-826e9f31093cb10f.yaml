  - Sahara APIv2 is reaching a point of maturity. Therefore, new deployments
    should include an **unversioned** endpoint in the service catalog for the
    "data-processing" service, for the purposes of more intuitive version
    discovery. Eventually existing deployments should switch to an unversioned
    endpoint, too, but only after time is given for the use of older clients
    to be less likely.
