issues:
  - Ironic integration might be broken if floating IPs are used, due to the
    use of pre-created ports by the Sahara engine. The status of Ironic
    support was untested for this release.
deprecations:
  - Support for nova-network is removed, reflective of its removal from nova
    itself and from python-novaclient. use_neutron=False is unsupported.
