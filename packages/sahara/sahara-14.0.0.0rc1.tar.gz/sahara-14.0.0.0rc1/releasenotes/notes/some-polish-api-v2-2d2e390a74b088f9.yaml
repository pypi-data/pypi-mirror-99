  - Some polishings to APIv2 have been made in an effort to bring it from
    experimental (and therefore, evolving and unpredictable) to stable. More
    instances of `tenant_id` have been changed to `project_id`, in the
    cluster and job template APIs. `job_id` was changed to `job_template_id`
    in the job API. The newly-minted query string validation feature has been
    fixed to allow `show_progress` as a parameter on cluster GET; on a similar
    note some APIv2 endpoints which previously could be filtered by
    `hadoop_version` are now filtered by `plugin_version` instead. Also, the
    schema for cluster PATCH in APIv1.1 now no longer includes the key
    `update_keypair`; its prior inclusion was a mistake.
