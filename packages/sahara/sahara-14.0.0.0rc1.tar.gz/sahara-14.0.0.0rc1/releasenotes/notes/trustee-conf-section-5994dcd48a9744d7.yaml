deprecations:
  - |
    The use of [keystone_authtoken] credentials for trust creation is now
    deprecated. Please use the new [trustee] config section. The options
    ``username``, ``password``, ``project_name``, ``user_domain_name``,
    ``project_domain_name``, and ``auth_url`` (with version) are obligatory
    within that section.
