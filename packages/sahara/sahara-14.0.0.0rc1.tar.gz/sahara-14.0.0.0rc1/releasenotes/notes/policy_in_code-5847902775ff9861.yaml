features:
  - This feature allows the policy enforcement to be done in code thus
    facilitating better maintenance of the policy file. In code the default
    policies are set and the operator only needs to change the policy file
    if they wish to override the rule or role for a specific policy or
    operation. Also, a complete policy file can be generated using genconfig
    tool.
