fixes:
  - |
    With APIv2 we detected some inconsistencies on the policies. This patch
    updates the policy to fix those incosistencies.
other:
  - |
    All APIv2 policy names have been changed to the recommended format: specifically,
    changes to resource names (now _singular_, whereas previously they may have been
    _plural_, or otherwise inconsistent), action verbs (now fully independent of HTTP
    semantics) and overall formatting (hyphens replace underscores).
    Eventually, the remaining non-conforming policy names will be deprecated too.
