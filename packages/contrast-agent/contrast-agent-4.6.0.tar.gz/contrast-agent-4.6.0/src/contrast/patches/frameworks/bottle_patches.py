    Patch for bottle.SimpleTemplate.prepare.

    This is needed because of the unfortunate way bottle calls on
    `html_escape` as a kwarg in the prepare definition in SimpleTemplate.
    See https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py#L3952

    Because of this behavior, the `html_escape` func is not our patched
    `html_escape` defined in policy.
    By patching prepare, we intercept its call and instead of allowing
    it to use the default kwarg for `html_escape`, we pass our own
    patched `html_escape` in order to prevent false positive XSS findings.
