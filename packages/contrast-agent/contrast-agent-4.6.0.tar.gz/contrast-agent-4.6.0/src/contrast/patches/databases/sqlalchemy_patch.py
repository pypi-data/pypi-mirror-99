    We've seen this before. In python2, instance method objects save their real
    underlying function under their `__func__` attribute. To line up properly with
    SQLAlchemy's instance check, we need type(wrapped_method) to return `function`.

    This is unfortunate because it's probably incorrect, but it's SQLAlchemy's fault.
    Wrapt assumes that accessors aren't purposely bypassing the descriptor protocol
    when accessing a wrapped instance method - but if they do, the behavior is wrong.

    We have to cater to SQLAlchemy here, since it's really unlikely anyone else will
    be type-checking this method.

    SQLAlchemy performs some downright demonic introspection on the __init__ methods
    for DefaultDialect and subclasses (see sqlalchemy.util.langhelpers.get_cls_kwargs).
    The only way we can get around this is to use wrapt's magic to create a very well-
    behaved patch for this method. If we tried to use patch_cls_or_instance here, or
    even if we created a naive wrapper for this method, SQLAlchemy's introspection
    would lead to failures internal to the library.

    Hopefully one day this will be our one true patching strategy, as it's
    shockingly robust - it successfully imitates the original method even against
    tactics as powerful as argument introspection.

    Additionally, the patch_manager is not equipped to handle this case. This is
    likely due to the fact that the wrapped method is an instance of a callable class,
    not actually a function. If we want to make use of wrapt wrappers in the future,
    we will need to update the patch_manager accordingly. We also can't check for
    __wrapped__, because DefaultDialect is already wrapped by SQLAlchemy!
