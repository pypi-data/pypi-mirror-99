    In some cases (SQLAlchemy), we need to instrument an unknown PEP-249 compliant
    adapter. We only have a reference to the adapter module, and we can't make any
    assumptions about the existence of `adapter.Cursor`, since this is not guaranteed
    by the spec.

    We are only guaranteed the following:
    - the adapter has a `connection()` method, which returns an instance of Connection
    - the Connection object has a `cursor()` method, which returns an instance of Cursor
    - the Cursor has `execute()` and `executemany()` methods

    This requires a somewhat roundabout instrumentation strategy:
    - on the first call to adapter.connect(), we can access the Connection class
    - on the first call to Connection.cursor(), we can access the Cursor class
    - this lets us instrument Cursor.execute() and Cursor.executemany()
