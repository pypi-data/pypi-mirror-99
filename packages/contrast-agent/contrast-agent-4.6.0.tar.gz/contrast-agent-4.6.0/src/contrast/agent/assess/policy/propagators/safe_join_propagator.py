    Sanitizing propagator for flask.helpers.safe_join

    The safe_join function is used to join path components to a base directory in such
    a way that a path traversal attack is not possible. The tag propagation from
    sources to target is the same as the basic str.join propagation. Unlike str.join,
    in the case of safe_join, the separator is not given as a source. Instead, we
    simply set it to posixpath.sep since that is what is used by safe_join under the
    hood.

    The most important difference between str.join and safe_join is the tags that are
    applied. The safe_join propagator adds sanitizing tags since the path components
    passed to safe_join can't contribute to a path traversal attack. However, safe_join
    _assumes_ that the base directory is trusted. We can't make that same assumption
    since it actually can come from anywhere, including an untrusted source. Since the
    base directory isn't validated by safe_join in any way, we do not apply safe tags
    to the corresponding range in the target.
