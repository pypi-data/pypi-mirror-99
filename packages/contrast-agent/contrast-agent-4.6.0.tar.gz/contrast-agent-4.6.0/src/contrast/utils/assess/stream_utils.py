class BaseStreamProxy(ObjectProxy):
    """
    Base class for implementing stream proxies (marking streams as sources).

    Methods are represented as attributes on the proxy itself which enables us to
    "overwrite" methods even on objects that can't be monkey-patched.

    Proxying a stream (as opposed to instrumenting it directly) ensures that we'll
    be able to modify all relevant attributes. We don't necessarily know the type of
    the stream object we're instrumenting, and sometimes its attributes are
    read-only.

    We also can't use a simple class here, because some frameworks (WebOb) set
    additional attributes on wsgi.input, such as `seek`. We want to maintain as much
    of the original object's functionality as possible, so the best way is with an
    object proxy.

    See https://wrapt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wrappers.html#proxy-object-attributes
    for details about object property attributes.

    TODO: PYT-917 In the future we may want to instrument write and writelines. This
        would require us to treat the stream more like a propagator than a source
        because trusted data could be written to it.

    TODO: PYT-917 We may eventually need to consider the less common __iter__ method,
        which is currently not instrumented. Werkzeug (at least) does not use __iter__
        when parsing wsgi.input; we may have to investigate WebOb's parser as well. It's
        also possible that the underlying implementation of __iter__ calls an already
        instrumented method for BytesIO, StringIO, etc.

    We might eventually be able to align this proxy hierarchy more closely with
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#class-hierarchy.
    Note that file objects in python 2 do not line up with this inheritance pattern:
    https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-file-objects.
