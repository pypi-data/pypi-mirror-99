    Applies unsafe-code-execution rule for exec statement in PY2

    determine whether the rule has been violated, we need to do a reverse
    lookup based on the pointer value of the underlying char buffer that
    corresponds to the string object. This is because our hook for the exec
    statement does not see a PyObject but instead is only passed the underlying
    char buffer.
