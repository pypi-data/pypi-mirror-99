    A subclass of the WSGI middleware that provides pyramid route coverage.
    "configuration scanning" in pyramid is handled dynamically with triggers.

    This is not a pyramid-style tween - it must wrap pyramid's WSGI application
    directly. The WSGI app is typically returned by a call to some Configurator
    instance's `make_wsgi_app()`.

        This deviates slightly from typical WSGI Middleware API, because we need
        `registry` to get framework-specific information about the application.

        The application's `Registry` is commonly available as an attribute on the
        `Configurator` instance used to construct the application. It is also available
        as an attribute of the original WSGI application object returned by
        `Configurator.make_wsgi_app()`. Note that we can't guarantee that the WSGI app
        passed to this constructor has a `registry` attribute, since the original
        Pyramid WSGI app might have already been wrapped by other WSGI middlewares.
