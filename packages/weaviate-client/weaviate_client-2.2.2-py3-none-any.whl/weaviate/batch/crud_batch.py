        As it can be noticed the first object from the batch was not added/created, but the batch
        was succesfully created. The batch creation can be successful even if all the objects were
        NOT created. Check the status of the batch objects to find which object and why creation
        failed. Alternatively use 'Client().data_object.create' for Object creation that throw an
        error if data item is inconsistent or creation/addition failed.

        NOTE: The same is NOT true for ReferenceBatchRequest objects.

        Object that does not exist in weaviate.

        Objects that exist in weaviate.

        for more information).

        >>> result = client.batch.create(batch)

        As it can be noticed the reference batch creation is successful (no error thrown). Now we

        Both references were added successfully but one of them is corrupted (links two objects
        of unexisting class and one of the objects is not yet created).

        Adding References in batch is faster but it ignors validations like class name,
        property name and/or if both objects exist, resulting in a SUCESSFUL reference creation of
        unexisting object types and/or unexisting properties. If the consistency of the References
        is wanted use 'Client().data_object.reference.add' to have additional validation against
        the weaviate schema.

        ----------
        batch_request : weaviate.batch.BatchRequest
            Contains all the data objects that should be added in one batch.
            Note: Should be a sub-class of BatchRequest since BatchRequest

        Returns
        -------

            If the network connection to weaviate fails.
        weaviate.UnexpectedStatusCodeException
            If weaviate reports a none OK status.
