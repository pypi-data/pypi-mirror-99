    "snapshot_support" is no longer automatically included as an extra-spec
    in share types created via manila-ui. If the share type has to match backends
    that support snapshots, explicitly specify "snapshot_support" in the
    "Extra specs" field while creating share types.
    This change does not modify pre-existing share types.
