qpter is the Qt version of pter (ie. pter with a graphical user interface)
and supports mostly the same features but sometimes looks for other
sections in the configuration.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-c configuration\fP
Path to the configuration file you wish to use. The default is
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pter/pter.conf\fP (usually
\fB~/.config/pter/pter.conf\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-h\fP
Show the help.
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP
Show the version of pter/qpter.
.TP
.B \fB\-u\fP
Check whether a new version of pter is available on pypi (requires an
internet connection).
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP
Only available for qpter: either start qpter, immediately open the New
Task panel. Or, if qpter is running already, bring it to the foreground
and open the New Task panel.
.TP
.B \fBfilename\fP
Path to your todo.txt file. The first file that you provide is the one
where new tasks will be created in.

.SH FILES
.sp
Aside from the data files in the todo.txt format (see \fI\%Conforming to\fP),
pter\(aqs behaviour can be configured through a configuration file.
.sp
The configuration file\(aqs default location is at \fB~/.config/pter/pter.conf\fP\&.
.sp
There should have been an example configuration file, \fBexample.conf\fP distributed with your copy of pter that can give you an idea on how that works. In this documentation you will find the full explanation.
.sp
The configuration file is entirely optional and each option has a default
value. That allows you to run pter just fine without ever configuring
anything.
.sp
The configuration file has four sections (the names are case\-sensitive):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%General\fP, for general behaviour,
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Symbols\fP, for icons used in the (task) display,
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Keys\fP, to override default keyboard controls in lists,
.IP \(bu 2
Editor:Keys, to override the default keyboard controls in edit fields (detailed in \fI\%Keys\fP),
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Colors\fP, for coloring the TUI,
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%GUI:Colors\fP, for coloring the tasks in the GUI,
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Highlight\fP, for coloring specific tags of tasks,
.IP \(bu 2
GUI:Highlight, for coloring specific tags of tasks (GUI version, see \fI\%Highlight\fP).

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBuse\-colors\fP
Whether or not to use colors. Defaults to \(aqyes\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBscroll\-margin\fP
How many lines to show at the lower and upper margin of lists. Defaults
to \(aq5\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBsafe\-save\fP
Safe save means that changes are written to a temporary file and that
file is moved over the actual file after writing was completed.
Defaults to \(aqyes\(aq.
.sp
This can be problematic if your files are in folders synchronised with
cloud services.
.TP
.B \fBsearch\-case\-sensitive\fP
Whether or not to search case\-sensitive. Defaults to \(aqyes\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBhuman\-friendly\-dates\fP
Here you can define what fields of a task, that are known to contain a
date, should be displayed in a more human\-friendly way. By default no
dates are translated.
.sp
Human\-friendly means that instead of a \(aqYYYY\-MM\-DD\(aq format it might
show \(aqnext wednesday\(aq, \(aqtomorrow\(aq, or \(aqin 2 weeks\(aq. It means that
dates, that are further away (in the future or the past) will be less
precise.
.sp
Possible values are \fBdue\fP (for due dates), \fBt\fP (for the
threshold/tickler dates), \fBcompleted\fP (for completion dates),
\fBcreated\fP (for creation dates), or \fBall\fP (for all of the above).
You can also combine these values by comma separating them like this:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[General]
human\-friendly\-dates = due, t
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBtask\-format\fP
The format string to use for displaying tasks. Defaults to "\fB{selection: >} {nr: >} {done} {tracking }{due }{(pri) }{description}\fP".
.sp
See \fI\%Task Format\fP below for more details.
.TP
.B \fBclear\-contexts\fP
A list of comma separated contexts (without the leading \fB@\fP) to remove from a task
when it is being marked as done.
.sp
For example, you might want to remove the \fB@in\fP context or any
\fB@today\fP tags when marking a task as done. In that case
\fBclear\-contexts\fP should be set to \fBin, today\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdefault\-threshold\fP
The default \fBt:\fP search value to use, even when no other search has
been defined. Defaults to \(aqtoday\(aq.
.sp
This option supports \fI\%Relative Dates\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdelegation\-marker\fP
Marker to add to a task when delegating it. Defaults to \fB@delegated\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBdelegation\-action\fP
Action to take when delegating a task.
One of \(aqnone\(aq, or \(aqmail\-to\(aq (defaulting to \(aqmail\-to\(aq).
.sp
\(aqnone\(aq does nothing, but \(aqmail\-to\(aq will attempt to start your email
program to write an email. If your task has a \(aqto:\(aq attribute (or
whatever you set up for \fBdelegation\-to\fP, it will be used as the
recipient for the email.
.TP
.B \fBdelegation\-to\fP
Attribute name to use when delegating a task via email. Defaults to
\fBto\fP\&. Eg. "clean the dishes to:bob" will compose the email to "bob"
when delegating a task and the delegation action is "mail\-to".
.TP
.B \fBprotocols\fP
What protocols should be considered when using the \(aqOpen URL\(aq function
on a task. Defaults to \fBhttp, https, mailto, ftp, ftps\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBadd\-creation\-date\fP
Whether or not to automatically always add the creation date of a task
to it when creating the task. Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBcreate\-from\-search\fP
If set to \fByes\fP, positive expressions (that do not refer to time or
\fIdone\fP) of the active search (eg. \fI@context +project word\fP, but not
\fI\-@context due:+7d done:y \-others\fP) will be added automatically to a
newly created task. Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBauto\-id\fP
Whether or not to automatically add an ID to newly created tasks.
Defaults to \fBno\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBhide\-sequential\fP
Whether or not to automatically hide tasks that have uncompleted
preceding tasks (see \fI\%Task Sequences\fP). Defaults to \fByes\fP\&.

.SS Colors
.sp
Colors are defined in pairs, separated by comma: foreground and background
color. Some color\(aqs names come with a \fBsel\-\fP prefix so you can define the
color when it is a selected list item.
.sp
You may decide to only define one value, which will then be used as the text
color. The background color will then be taken from \fBnormal\fP or \fBsel\-normal\fP
respectively.
.sp
If you do not define the \fBsel\-\fP version of a color, pter will use the
normal version and put the \fBsel\-normal\fP background to it.
.sp
If you specify a special background for the normal version, but none for the
selected version, the special background of the normal version will be used
for the selected version, too!

.SS Highlight
.sp
Highlights work exactly like colors, but the color name is whatever tag you
want to have colored.
.sp
If you wanted to highlight the \fBdue:\fP tag of a task, you could define
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[Highlight]
due = 8, 0
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the GUI, use \fBGUI:Highlight\fP\&. The colors can be specific as hex
values (3, or 6\-digits) or named:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[GUI:Highlight]
due = red
t = #4ee
to = #03fe4b
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Task Format
.sp
The task formatting is a mechanism that allows you to configure how tasks are
being displayed in pter. It uses placeholders for elements of a task that you can
order and align using a mini language similar to \fI\%Python’s format
specification
mini\-language\fP, but
much less complete.
.sp
qpter uses only part of the definition, see below in the list of field
names, if you only care for qpter.
.sp
If you want to show the task’s age and description, this is your
task format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
task\-format = {age} {description}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The space between the two fields is printed! If you don’t want a space
between, this is your format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
task\-format = {age}{description}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You might want to left align the age, to make sure all task descriptions start
below each other:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
task\-format = {age: <}{description}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the age field will be left aligned and the right side is filled with
spaces. You prefer to fill it with dots?:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
task\-format = {age:.<}{description}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Right align works the same way, just with \fB>\fP\&. There is currently no
centering.
.sp
Suppose you want to surround the age with brackets, then you would want to use
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
task\-format = {[age]:.<}{description}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Even if no age is available, you will always see the \fB[...]\fP (the amount of
periods depends on the age of the oldest visible task; in this example some
task is at least 100 days old).
.sp
If you don’t want to show a field, if it does not exist, for example the
completion date when a task is not completed, then you must not align it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
task\-format = {[age]:.<}{completed}{description}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can still add extra characters left or right to the field. They will not
be shown if the field is missing:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
task\-format = {[age}:.<}{ completed 😃 }{description}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now there will be an emoji next to the completion date, or none if the task has
no completion date.
.sp
All that being said, qpter uses the same \fBtask\-format\fP configuration
option to show tasks, but will disregard some fields (see below) and only
use the field names, but not alignment or decorations.
.SS Field Names
.sp
The following fields exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdescription\fP, the full description text of the task
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcreated\fP, the creation date (might be missing)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBage\fP, the age of the task in days (might be missing)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcompleted\fP, the completion date (might be missing, even if the task is completed)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdone\fP, the symbol for a completed or not completed task (see below)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpri\fP, the character for the priority (might not be defined)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdue\fP, the symbol for the due status (overdue, due today, due tomorrow; might not be defined)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBduedays\fP, in how many days a task is due (negative number when overdue tasks)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBselection\fP, the symbol that’s shown when this task is selected in the list (disregarded in qpter)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnr\fP, the number of the task in the list (disregarded in qpter)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtracking\fP, the symbol to indicate that you started time tracking of this task (might not be there)
.UNINDENT

.sp
\fBdescription\fP is potentially consuming the whole line, so you might want to
put it last in your \fBtask\-format\fP\&.
.SS GUI
.sp
The GUI specific options are defined in the \fB[GUI]\fP section:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBfont\fP
The name of the font to use for the task list.
.TP
.B \fBfont\-size\fP
The font size to use for the task list. You can specify the size either
in pixel (eg. \fB12px\fP) or point size (eg. \fB14pt\fP). Unlike pixel
sizes, point sizes may be a non\-integer number, eg. \fB16.8pt\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBsingle\-instance\fP
Whether or not qpter may only be started once.
.TP
.B \fBclickable\fP
If enabled, this allows you to click on URLs (see option \fBprotocols\fP
in \fI\%General\fP) to open them in a webbrowser, and to click on contexts
and projects to add them to the current search. Disabling this option
may improve performance. The default is \fByes\fP, ie. URLs, contexts,
and projects are clickable.
.TP
.B \fBdaily\-reload\fP
The time (in format HH:MM) when qpter will automatically reload upon
passing midnight. Defaults to 00:00.

.SH RELATIVE DATES
.sp
Instead of providing full dates for searches or for \fBdue:\fP or \fBt:\fP when
editing tasks, you may write things like \fBdue:+4d\fP, for example, to specify
a date in 4 days.
.sp
A relative date will be expanded into the actual date when editing a task
or when being used in a search.
.sp
The suffix \fBd\fP stands for days, \fBw\fP for weeks, \fBm\fP for months, \fBy\fP for years.
The leading \fB+\fP is implied when left out and if you don’t specify it, \fBd\fP is
assumed.
.sp
\fBdue\fP and \fBt\fP tags can be as simple as \fBdue:1\fP (short for \fBdue:+1d\fP, ie.
tomorrow) or as complicated as \fBdue:+15y\-2m+1w+3d\fP (two months before the date
that is in 15 years, 1 week and 3 days).
.sp
\fBdue\fP and \fBt\fP also support relative weekdays. If you specify \fBdue:sun\fP it is
understood that you mean the next Sunday. If today is Sunday, this is
equivalent to \fBdue:1w\fP or \fBdue:+7d\fP\&.
.sp
Finally there are \fBtoday\fP and \fBtomorrow\fP as shortcuts for the current day and
the day after that, respectively. These terms exist for readability only, as
they are equivalent to \fB0d\fP (or even just \fB0\fP) and \fB+1d\fP (or \fB1d\fP, or even
just \fB1\fP), respectively.
.SH SEARCHING
.sp
One of the most important parts of pter is the search. You can search for
tasks by means of search queries. These queries can become very long at
which point you can save and restore them (see below in \fI\%Named Searches\fP).
.sp
Unless configured otherwise by you, the search is case\-sensitive.
.sp
Here\(aqs a detailed explanation of search queries.
.sp
Some fxample search queries are listed in \fI\%Named Searches\fP\&.
.SS Search for phrases
.sp
The easiest way to search is by phrase in tasks.
.sp
For example, you could search for \fBread\fP to find any task containing the word
\fBread\fP or \fBbread\fP or \fBreading\fP\&.
.sp
To filter out tasks that do \fInot\fP contain a certain phrase, you can search with
\fBnot:word\fP or, abbreviated, \fB\-word\fP\&.
.SS Search for tasks that are completed
.sp
By default all tasks are shown, but you can show only tasks that are not
completed by searching for \fBdone:no\fP\&.
.sp
To only show tasks that you already marked as completed, you can search for
\fBdone:yes\fP instead.
.SS Hidden tasks
.sp
Even though not specified by the todotxt standard, some tools provide the
“hide” flag for tasks: \fBh:1\fP\&. pytodoweb understands this, too, and by default
hides these tasks.
.sp
To show hidden tasks, search for \fBhidden:yes\fP\&. Instead of searching for
\fBhidden:\fP you can also search for \fBh:\fP (it’s a synonym).
.SS Projects and Contexts
.sp
To search for a specific project or context, just search using the
corresponding prefix, ie. \fB+\fP or \fB@\fP\&.
.sp
For example, to search for all tasks for project "FindWaldo", you could search
for \fB+FindWaldo\fP\&.
.sp
If you want to find all tasks that you filed to the context "email", search
for \fB@email\fP\&.
.sp
Similar to the search for phrases, you can filter out contexts or projects by
search for \fBnot:@context\fP, \fBnot:+project\fP, or use the abbreviation \fB\-@context\fP
or \fB\-+project\fP respectively.
.SS Priority
.sp
Searching for priority is supported in two different ways: you can either
search for all tasks of a certain priority, eg. \fBpri:a\fP to find all tasks of
priority \fB(A)\fP\&.
Or you can search for tasks that are more important or less important than a
certain priority level.
.sp
Say you want to see all tasks that are more important than priority \fB(C)\fP, you
could search for \fBmoreimportant:c\fP\&. The keyword for “less important” is
\fBlessimportant\fP\&.
.sp
\fBmoreimportant\fP and \fBlessimportant\fP can be abbreviated with \fBmi\fP and \fBli\fP
respectively.
.SS Due date
.sp
Searching for due dates can be done in two ways: either by exact due date or
by defining “before” or “after”.
.sp
If you just want to know what tasks are due on 2018\-08\-03, you can search for
\fBdue:2018\-08\-03\fP\&.
.sp
But if you want to see all tasks that have a due date set \fIafter\fP 2018\-08\-03,
you search for \fBdueafter:2018\-08\-03\fP\&.
.sp
Similarly you can search with \fBduebefore\fP for tasks with a due date before a
certain date.
.sp
\fBdueafter\fP and \fBduebefore\fP can be abbreviated with \fBda\fP and \fBdb\fP respectively.
.sp
If you only want to see tasks that have a due date, you can search for
\fBdue:yes\fP\&. \fBdue:no\fP also works if you don’t want to see any due dates.
.sp
Searching for due dates supports \fI\%Relative Dates\fP\&.
.SS Creation date
.sp
The search for task with a certain creation date is similar to the search
query for due date: \fBcreated:2017\-11\-01\fP\&.
.sp
You can also search for tasks created before a date with \fBcreatedbefore\fP (can
be abbreviated with \fBcrb\fP) and for tasks created after a date with
\fBcreatedafter\fP (or short \fBcra\fP).
.sp
To search for tasks created in the year 2008 you could search for
\fBcreatedafter:2007\-12\-31 createdbefore:2009\-01\-01\fP or short \fBcra:2007\-12\-31
crb:2009\-01\-01\fP\&.
.sp
Searching for creation dates supports \fI\%Relative Dates\fP\&.
.SS Completion date
.sp
The search for tasks with a certain completion date is pretty much identical
to the search for tasks with a certain creation date (see above), but using
the search phrases \fBcompleted\fP, \fBcompletedbefore\fP (the short version is \fBcob\fP), or
\fBcompletedafter\fP (short form is \fBcoa\fP).
.sp
Searching for completion dates supports \fI\%Relative Dates\fP\&.
.SS Threshold or Tickler search
.sp
pter understand the the non\-standard suggestion to use \fBt:\fP tags to
indicate that a task should not be active prior to the defined date.
.sp
If you still want to see all tasks, even those with a threshold in the future,
you can search for \fBthreshold:\fP (or, short, \fBt:\fP). See also the
\fI\%General\fP configuration option \(aqdefault\-threshold\(aq.
.sp
You can also pretend it’s a certain date in the future (eg. 2042\-02\-14) and
see what tasks become available then by searching for \fBthreshold:2042\-02\-14\fP\&.
.sp
\fBthreshold\fP can be abbreviated with \fBt\fP\&. \fBtickler\fP is also a synonym for
\fBthreshold\fP\&.
.sp
Searching for \fBthreshold\fP supports \fI\%Relative Dates\fP\&.
.SS Task Identifier
.sp
You can search for task IDs with \fBid:\fP\&. If you search for multiple
task IDs, all of these are searched for, not a task that has all given IDs.
.sp
You can also exclude tasks by ID from a search with \fBnot:id:\fP or
\fB\-id:\fP\&.
.SS Sequence
.sp
You can search for tasks that are supposed to follow directly or indirectly
other tasks by searching for \fBafter:taskid\fP (\fBtaskid\fP should be the
\fBid\fP of a task). Any task that is supposed to be completed after that
task, will be found.
.sp
If the configuration option \fBhide\-sequential\fP is set to \fByes\fP (the
default), tasks are hidden that have uncompleted preceding tasks (see
\fI\%General\fP).
.sp
If you want to see all tasks, disregarding their declared sequence, you can
search for \fBafter:\fP (without anything after the \fB:\fP).
.SS Task References
.sp
Tasks that refer to other tasks by any of the existing means (eg. \fBref:\fP
or \fBafter:\fP) can be found by searching for \fBref:\fP\&.
.sp
If you search using multiple references (eg. \fBref:4,5\fP or \fBref:4
ref:5\fP) the task IDs are considered a logical \fBor\fP\&.
.SS Filename
.sp
You can search for parts of a filename that a task belongs to with
\fBfile:\fP\&. \fBnot:\fP can be used to exclude tasks that belong to a certain
file.
.sp
For example: \fBfile:todo.txt\fP or \fB\-file:archive\fP\&.
.SH SORTING
.sp
Tasks can be sorted by passing \fBsort:\fP to the search. The properties of
tasks to sort by are separated by comma. The following properties can be
used for sorting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdue_in\fP
The number of days until the task is due, if there is a due
date given.
.TP
.B \fBcompleted\fP
Whether or not the task has been completed.
.TP
.B \fBpriority\fP
The priority of the task, if any.
.TP
.B \fBlinenr\fP
The line of the task in its todo.txt file
.TP
.B \fBfile\fP
The name of the todo.txt file the task is in.
.TP
.B \fBproject\fP
The first project (alphabetically sorted) of the task.
.TP
.B \fBcontext\fP
The first context (alphabetically sorted) of the task.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default sorting order is \fBcompleted,due_in,priority,linenr\fP and will
be assumed if no \fBsort:\fP is provided in the search.
.SH NAMED SEARCHES
.sp
Search queries can become very long and it would be tedious to type them
again each time.
.sp
To get around it, you can save search queries and give each one a name. The
default keyboard shortcut to save a search is "s" and to load a search is
"l".
.sp
The named queries are stored in your configuration folder in the file
\fB~/.config/pter/searches.txt\fP\&.
.sp
Each line in that file is one saved search query in the form \fBname = search
query\fP\&.
.sp
Here are some useful example search queries:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Due this week = done:no duebefore:mon
Done today = done:yes completed:0
Open tasks = done:no
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH TIME TRACKING
.sp
pter can track the time you spend on a task. By default, type "t" to
start tracking. This will add a \fBtracking:\fP attribute with the current local
date and time to the task.
.sp
When you select that task again and type "t", the \fBtracking:\fP tag will be
removed and the time spent will be saved in the tag \fBspent:\fP as hours and
minutes.
.sp
If you start and stop tracking multiple times, the time in \fBspent:\fP will
accumulate accordingly. The smallest amount of time tracked is one minute.
.sp
This feature is non\-standard for todo.txt but compatible with every other
implementation.
.SH DELEGATING TASKS
.sp
The \fBdelegate\fP function (on shortcut \fB>\fP (pter) or \fBCtrl+G\fP (qpter)
by default) can be used to mark a task as delegated and trigger the
delegation action.
.sp
When delegating a task the configured marker is being added to the task
(configured by \fBdelegation\-marker\fP in the configuration file).
.sp
The delegation action is configured by setting the \fBdelegation\-action\fP in
the configuration file to \fBmail\-to\fP\&. In that case an attempt is made to
open your email program and start a new email. In case you defined a
\fBto:\fP (configurable by defining \fBdelegation\-to\fP) in your task
description, that will be used as the recipient for the email.
.SH UNIQUE TASK IDENTIFIERS
.sp
Tasks can be given an identifier with the \fBid:\fP attribute. pter can
support you in creating unique IDs by creating a task with \fBid:#auto\fP or,
shorter, \fBid:#\fP\&.
.sp
If you would like to group your tasks IDs, you can provide a prefix to the
id:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Clean up the +garage id:clean3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you now create a task with \fBid:clean#\fP or \fBid:clean#auto\fP, the next
task will be given \fBid:clean4\fP\&.
.sp
In case you want all your tasks to be created with a unique ID, have a look
at the configuration option \fBauto\-id\fP (in section \fI\%General\fP).
.sp
You can refer to other tasks using the attribute \fBref:\fP following the id
of the task that you are referring to. This may also be a comma separated
list of tasks (much like \fBafter:\fP, see \fI\%Task Sequences\fP).
.SH TASK SEQUENCES
.sp
You can declare that a task is supposed to be done after another task has
been completed by setting the \fBafter:\fP attribute to the preceding task.
.sp
By default, ie. with an empty search, any task that is declared to be
\fBafter:\fP some other preceding task will not be shown unless the preceding
task has been marked as done.
.sp
If you do not like this feature, you can disable it in the
\fBhide\-sequential\fP in the configuration file (see \fI\%General\fP).
.SS Examples
.sp
These three tasks may exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Buy potatoes @market id:1
Make fries @kitchen id:2 after:1
Eat fries for dinner after:2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This means that \fBMake fries\fP won’t show in the list of tasks until \fBBuy
potatoes\fP has been completed. Similarily \fBEat fries for dinner\fP will not
show up until \fBMake fries\fP has been completed.
.sp
You can declare multiple \fBafter:\fP attributes, or comma separate multiple
prerequisites to indicate that \fIall\fP preceding tasks must be completed
before a task may be shown:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Buy oil id:1
Buy potatoes id:2
Buy plates id:3
Make fries id:4 after:1,2
Eat fries after:3 after:4
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case \fBMake fries\fP will not show up until both \fBBuy oil\fP and
\fBBuy potatoes\fP has been completed.
.sp
Similarly \fBEat fries\fP requires both tasks, \fBMake fries\fP and \fBBuy
plates\fP, to be completed.
.SH GETTING THINGS DONE
.sp
With pter you can apply the Getting Things Done method to a single todo.txt
file by using context and project tags, avoiding multiple lists.
.sp
For example, you could have a \fB@in\fP context for the list of all tasks
that are new. Now you can just search for \fB@in\fP (and save it as a named search) to find all new tasks.
.sp
To see all tasks that are on your "Next task" list, a good start is to
search for "\fBdone:no not:@in\fP" (and save this search query, too).
.SH EXTENSIONS TO TODO.TXT
.sp
Pter is fully compatible with the standard format, but also supports
the following extra key/value tags:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBafter:4\fP, signifies that this entry can only be started once entry with \fBid:4\fP has been completed.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdue:2071\-01\-01\fP, defines a due date for this task.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBh:1\fP, hides a task.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBid:3\fP, allows you to assign a unique identifier to entries in the todo.txt, like \fB3\fP\&. pter will accept when there non\-unique IDs, but of course uniquely identifying entries will be tricky.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBref:6\fP, indicate that this task refers to the task with \fBid:6\fP\&.  Comma\-separated IDs are supported, like \fBref:13,9\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBspent:5h3m\fP, pter can be used for time tracking and will store the duration that was spent on a task in the \fBspent\fP attribute.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBt:2070\-12\-24\fP, the threshold tag can be used to hide before the given date has come.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBto:person\fP, when a task has been delegated (by using a delegation marker like \fB@delegated\fP), \fBto\fP can be used to indicate to whom the task has been delegated. The option is configurable, see \fBdelegation\-to\fP above for details.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtracking:\fP, a technical tag used for time tracking. It indicates that you started working on the task and wanted to do time tracking. The value is the date and time when you started working. Upon stopping tracking, the spent time will be stored in the \fBspent\fP tag.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFORMING TO
.sp
pter works with and uses the todo.txt file format and strictly adheres to the format
as described at \fI\%http://todotxt.org/\fP\&. Additional special key/value tags are
described in the previous section.
.SH BUGS
.sp
Probably plenty. Please report your findings at \fI\%https://github.com/vonshednob/pter\fP or via email to the authors.
