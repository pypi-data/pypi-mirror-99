Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, on 30 November 1874,
at which time the United Kingdom was the dominant world power.
Direct descendants of the Dukes of Marlborough, his family were
among the highest levels of the British aristocracy, and thus
he was born into the country's governing elite.
His paternal grandfather, John Spencer-Churchill,
7th Duke of Marlborough, had been a Member of Parliament (MP)
for ten years, a member of the Conservative Party who served
in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.
His own father, Lord Randolph Churchill, had been elected
Conservative MP for Woodstock in 1873.
His mother, Jennie Churchill (n√©e Jerome), was from an
American family whose substantial wealth derived from
finance. The couple had met in August 1873, and were
engaged three days later, marrying at the British Embassy
in Paris in April 1874. The couple lived beyond their income
and were frequently in debt; according to the biographer
Sebastian Haffner, the family were "rich by normal
standards but poor by those of the rich".""".replace("\n", " ")
