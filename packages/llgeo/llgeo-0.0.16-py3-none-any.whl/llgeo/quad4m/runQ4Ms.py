    ''' This runs a QUAD4M stage ASSUMING A VERY SPECIFIC FILE STRUCTURE
        
    Purpose
    -------
    This automates running several stages of QUAD4M analyses, where each stage
    constitutes a group of QUAD4M models that share some properties.
    THIS ASSUMES A VERY SPECIFIC FILE STRUCTURE:
    
        dir_q4m (contains .EXE file) 
        |
        |--> Quad4MU.exe
        |
        |--> stages[0] --> contains inputs for stage 0; will contain all outputs
        |
        |--> stages[1] --> contains inputs for stage 1; will contain all outputs
        :
        |--> stages[-1]--> contains inputs for stage N; will contain all outputs

    
    Parameters
    ----------
    stages : list of str
        Each element is the name of a subdirector in dir_q4m that contains input
        files for analyses within this stage.
        Each stage subdirectory must contain .q4r and .dat files for each model
        and output files (.out .bug .acc and/or .str) will be saved there.
        
    dir_q4m : str
        relative or absolute directory to where .EXE file is saved and where
        stage subdirectories are located.

    nthreads : int
        Number of threads to use when running analyses (make sure to leave one
        or two open for the OS)

    del_exist : bool (optional)
        If true, will delete all output files that already exist in stages
        subdirectories. Defaults to false.

    post : bool (optional)
        If true, each model will be post-processed as the simulations occurr, 
        saving a single .pkl file for each model with the analysis results.
        Defaults to false.

    del_txt : bool (optional)
        If true (and post = true), the text files for QUAD4M analyses will all
        be deleted. Defaults to false. Note that the files will only be deleted
        if the model was deemed to finish succcessfully, so that errors can be
        properly debugged.

def runQ4M(dir_q4m, dir_wrk, dir_out, file_q4r, file_dat, file_out, file_bug):
    ''' Runs a single simulation of QUAD4MU, given all input files and dirs.
    
    Purpose
    -------
    Given a QUAD4M input file, a soil reduction file, and output locations, this
    function runs the QUAD4M excecutable using WINE and prints the standard out-
    put and error to a file.
    
    A few important notes:
        1) This code will only work on a Linux operating system.
        2) Windows emulator WINE must be installed to run the ".exe" file.
        3) Inside the .q4r file, the path to the earthquake motion is specified.
           User must make sure that path exists, this function can't check that.
        4) The working directory is changed to dir_q4m at the start of the fun-
           ction and then reverted. So, all paths must either be absolute, or
           relative to dir_q4m.
        5) All paths must end in "/" !!!
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    dir_q4m : str
        path containing the file 'Quad4MU.exe'. Note that the current
        directory will be changed to this location while running this function. 
    dir_wrk : str
        path to working directory, where .q4r and .dat files are stored
         for this simulation. Must be either relative to dir_q4m, or absolute.
    dir_out : str
        path to output directory, where QUAD4M outputs will be stored.
        Must be either relative to dir_q4m, or absolute.
    file_q4r : str
        name of input file, usually with extension ".q4r"
    file_dat : str
        name of file with modulus reduction and damping curves, usually with
        extension ".dat" 
    file_out : str
        name of file to store outputs, usually with extension ".out"
    file_bug : str
        name of file to store dump from QUAD4M (just progress on itertions), 
        usually with extension ".bug"
        
    Returns
    -------
    Nothing is returned driectly - simply creates output files. Returns False
    if an error is caught, true if QUAD4MU is run (maybe succesfully, maybe not)

    '''Runs a QUAD4M analysis and immediately post-processes the outputs.
        
    Purpose
    -------
    This is a wrapper function for "runQ4M" (this module) and "postprocessQ4M"
    (in "post_process.py" module).
    
    When a large amount of models are being run, the large input/output files
    required for the QUAD4M analyses can take up too much space. To avoid this,
    one can run the analyses then immediately extract the needed outputs to a
    python-friendly format, then delete the text files to save memory.  

    IMPORTANT: I ALWAYS ASSUME THAT ALL THE FILES HAVE THE SAME NAME FOR A GIVEN
    MODEL, AND THAT THE EXTENSION ARE: .q4r, .dat, .shk, .out, .bug, .acc, .str
    
    NOTE: See the documentation in the functions "runQ4M" and "postprocessQ4M"
          for detailed explanation on how these functions work. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    dir_q4m : str
        path containing the file 'Quad4MU.exe'. Note that the current
        directory will be changed to this location while running this function. 
    
    dir_wrk : str
        path to working directory, where .q4r and .dat files are stored
         for this simulation. MUST BE relative to dir_q4m.
    
    dir_out : str
        path to output directory, where QUAD4M outputs will be stored.
        MUST BE relative to dir_q4m.
    
    file_q4r : str
        name of input file, usually with extension ".q4r"
    
    file_dat : str
        name of file with modulus reduction and damping curves, usually with
        extension ".dat" 
    
    file_out : str
        name of file to store outputs, usually with extension ".out"
    
    file_bug : str
        name of file to store dump from QUAD4M (just progress on itertions), 
        usually with extension ".bug"

    del_txt : bool (optional)
        if true, all quad4M input and output files for this analysis will be
        deleted. Defaults to false. Note that the files will only be deleted
        if the model was deemed to finish succcessfully, so that errors can be
        properly debugged.

    Returns
    -------
    outputs : dict
        (Direct output from "postprocessQ4M") 
        Dictionary of outputs from the model, where the contents depend on the
        provided flags.
        If no flags are given, dictionary will include:
            ['model', 'run_success', 'peak_str', 'peak_acc', 'eq_props', 'Ts',
            'acc_hist', 'str_hist']
