The Documenten API CMIS adapter, or CMIS adapter, was commissioned by the 
municipality of Utrecht and further developed for the municipality of 
Súdwest-Fryslân. Just before its 1.0 release in 2020, the project became part
of the Open Zaak project.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Open Zaak that much
better:

    Joeri Bekker <joeri@maykinmedia.nl>
    Jorik Kraaikamp <jorik@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sergei Maertens <sergei@maykinmedia.nl>
    Silvia Amabilino <silvia@maykimmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    All municipalities who funded the project: Utrecht and Súdwest-Fryslân

    Dimpact for making the CMIS adapter a part of the Open Zaak project.

    BCT and Contezza for allowing us to test the CMIS adapter with their DMS
    solutions.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
