Python library to provide a reliable communication link with LightWaveRF second generation lights and switches.

## Installing

The easiest way is 

    pip3 install lightwave2

Or just copy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbadblunt/lightwave2/master/lightwave2/lightwave2.py into your project

## Using the library

#### Imports
You'll need to import the library

    from lightwave2 import lightwave2

If you want to see all the messages passed back and forth with the Lightwave servers, set the logging level to debug:

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    
#### Connecting
Start by authenticating with the LW servers.

    link = lightwave2.LWLink2("example@example.com", "password")
    
This sets up a `LWLink2` object called `link`, and gets an authentication token from LW which is stored in the object. We can now connect to the LW websockect service    
        
    link.connect()

#### Read hierarchy
Next:

    link.get_hierarchy()
    
This requests the LW server to tell us all of the registered "featuresets". A "featureset" is LW's word for a group of features (e.g. a light switch could have features for "power" and "brightness") - this is what I think of as a device, but that's not how LW describes them (sidenote: what LW considers to be a device depends on the generation of the hardware - for gen 1 hardware, devices and featuresets correspond, for gen2 a device corresponds to a physical object; e.g. a 2 gang switch is a single device, but 2 featuresets).

Running `get_hierarchy` populates a dictionary of all of the featuresets available. the dictionary keys are unique identifiers provided by LW, the values are `_LWRFFeatureSet` objects that hold information about the feature.

To see the objects:

    print(link.featuresets)
    
For a slightly more useful view: 
    
    for i in link.featuresets.values():
        print(i.name, i.featureset_id, i.features)

In my case this returns

    Garden Room 5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e {'switch': ['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-28-3157334318+1', 1], 'protection': ['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-29-3157334318+1', 0], 'dimLevel': ['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-30-3157334318+1', 40]}

This is a light switch with the name `Garden Room` and the featureset id `5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e` which we'll use in the example.

#### Reading the featuresets

The easiest way if you know the featureset id is just to use the item from the dictionary directly:

###### Name
    print(link.featuresets['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e'].name)
    
will give the name you assigned when you set up the device in the LW app. 

###### Type of device    

Is this featureset a (non-light) switch:
    
    print(link.featuresets['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e'].is_switch())

Or it is a light switch:

    print(link.featuresets['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e'].is_light())
    
Maybe it's a thermostat:

    print(link.featuresets['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e'].is_climate())

Or perhaps an energy meter:

    print(link.featuresets['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e'].is_energy())
    
Is it a generation 2 ("Smart series") device:
    
    print(link.featuresets['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e'].is_gen2())

###### Device features

This is how we find out the state of the device, and we will also use this information to control the device:

    print(link.featuresets['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e'].features)

`features` is a dictionary of the features within a given featureset. The keys are the names of the features, the values are a tuple with the first item as a unique feature id, the second as the current value.

E.g. for me, the above returns

    {'switch': ['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-28-3157334318+1', 1], 
    'protection': ['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-29-3157334318+1', 0], 
    'dimLevel': ['5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-30-3157334318+1', 40]}

showing the light is currently on (feature `switch`), the physical buttons are not locked (feature `protection`) and the brightness is set to 40% (feature `dimlevel`).

#### More reading the featuresets

The values of the featuresets are static and won't respond to changes in the state of the physical device (unless you set up a callback to handle messages from the server). If you want to make sure the values are up to date you can: 

    link.update_featureset_states()

Finally there are a handful of convenience methods if you just want to return devices of a particular type:

    print(link.get_switches())
    print(link.get_lights())
    print(link.get_climates())
    print(link.get_energy())

#### Writing to a feature
Turning on a switch/light, turning off a switch/light or setting the brightness level for a light is as follows:

    link.turn_on_by_featureset_id("5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e") 
    link.turn_off_by_featureset_id("5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e") 
    link.set_brightness_by_featureset_id("5bc4d06e87779374d29d7d9a-5bc4d61387779374d29fdd1e", 60) #Brightness in percent
    
Then there is one more method for a thermostat
    
    link.set_temperature_by_featureset_id(featureset_id, level)
    
Finally, for any other features you might want to read or write the value of, you can access them directly. Note that that this needs the **feature** unique id.
    
    link.read_feature(feature_id)
    link.write_feature(feature_id, value)
    
#### Getting notified when something changes

This library is all using async programming, so notifications will only really work if your code is also async and is managing the event loop. Nonetheless, you can try the following for an idea of how to get a callback when an event is spotted by the server:

    import asyncio
    
    def test():
         print("this is a test callback")
    
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(link.async_register_callback(test))
    
This will call the `test` function every time a change is detected to the state of one of the features. This is likely only useful if you then run `link.update_featureset_states()` to ensure the internal state of the object is consistent with your actual LW system.

#### async methods

As mentioned above, the library provdes async versions of all methods (in fact the sync versions described above are just wrappers for the async versions)

    async_get_hierarchy()
    async_update_featureset_states()
    async_write_feature(feature_id, value)
    async_read_feature(feature_id)
    async_turn_on_by_featureset_id(featureset_id)
    async_turn_off_by_featureset_id(featureset_id)
    async_set_brightness_by_featureset_id(featureset_id, level)
    async_set_temperature_by_featureset_id(featureset_id, level)
