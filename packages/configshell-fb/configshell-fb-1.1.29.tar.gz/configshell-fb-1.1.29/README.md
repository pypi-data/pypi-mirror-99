"fb" -- "free branch"
---------------------

configshell-fb is a fork of the "configshell" code written by
RisingTide Systems. The "-fb" differentiates between the original and
this version. Please ensure to use either all "fb" versions of the
targetcli components -- targetcli, rtslib, and configshell, or stick
with all non-fb versions, since they are no longer strictly
compatible.
