# Getting started

## Overview

Implementing Launchable is a two phase process:

1. First, you **record a build** and **record test results** every time tests run in your CI pipeline. Launchable uses this data to build a machine learning model.
2. Then, you update your CI pipeline to use the trained model to optimize test execution by **subsetting tests**.

How does this look in practice? Here's an example. Let's say you have a simple CI script that builds and tests your Rails app:

```bash
## build step
# build software
bundle install

## test step
# run tests
bundle exec rails test
```

After you've added Launchable, this script would look like:

```bash
## install the Launchable CLI
pip3 install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0

## build step

# before building software, send commit and build info
# to Launchable
launchable record build --name <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS]

# build software as usual
bundle install

## test step
# ask Launchable which tests to run for this build
launchable subset --build <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS] > subset.txt

# run those tests (note `-v $(cat tests.txt)`)
bundle exec rails test -v $(cat subset.txt)

# send test results to Launchable for this build
launchable record tests --build <BUILD NAME> [OPTIONS]
```

## Installing the CLI

The Launchable CLI is a Python3 package that can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade launchable~=1.0
```

You can install the CLI as a system package without `--user`, but this way you do not need root access. This is handy when you are adding this to your build script for your CI server.

The `--upgrade` flag makes sure to always install the latest `1.x` version.

Note that the CLI requires Python 3.5 or newer **and** Java 8 or newer.

## Setting your API key

You should have received an API key from us already \(if you havenâ€™t, let us know\). This authentication token allows the CLI to talk to the Launchable cloud service.

Youâ€™ll need to make this API key available as the `LAUNCHABLE_TOKEN` environment variable in the parts of your CI process that interact with Launchable. How you do this depends on your CI system:

## Verifying connectivity

You can run `launchable verify` in your script to test connectivity. If successful, you should receive an output like:

```bash
launchable verify  

Platform: macOS-11.1-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python version: 3.9.1
Java command: java
launchable version: 1.3.1
Your CLI configuration is successfully verified ðŸŽ‰
```

If you get an error, see [Troubleshooting](resources/troubleshooting.md).

It is always a good idea to run `launchable verify` in your build script, as this information is useful in case any problems arise. In that case, it is recommended to connect `|| true` so that the exit status is always `0`:

```bash
launchable verify || true
```

## Next steps

Now you can start training a model by [recording builds](training-a-model/recording-builds.md) and [recording test results](training-a-model/recording-test-results.md).
