# Generic file based test runner

## Getting started

First, follow the steps in the [Getting started](../getting-started.md) guide to install the Launchable CLI, set your API key, and verify your connection.

Then return to this page to complete the integration.

## About 

The "file based" test runner integration is primarily designed to work with test runners that not explicitly supported, such as custom test runners built in-house.

In order to work with Launchable through this integration mechanism, your test runner has to satisfy the following conditions:

* **File based**: your test runner accepts file names as an input of a test execution, to execute just those specified set of tests.
* **File names in JUnit reports**: your test runner has to produce results of tests in the JUnit compatible format, with additional attributes that capture the **file names** of the tests that run. If not, see [converting test reports to JUnit](../resources/convert-to-junit.md).

For example, [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started) is a test runner that meets those criteria. You write tests in JavaScript files:

```bash
$ cat foo.js
var assert = require('assert');
describe('Array', function() {
  describe('#indexOf()', function() {
    it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function() {
      assert.equal([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4), -1);
    });
  });
});
```

Mocha test runner takes those files as arguments...

```bash
$ mocha --reporter mocha-junit-reporter foo.js
```

...produces JUnit report files, where the name of the test file is captured, in this case the `file` attribute:

```bash
$ cat test-results.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<testsuites name="Mocha Tests" time="0.0000" tests="1" failures="0">
  <testsuite name="#indexOf()" file="/home/kohsuke/ws/foo.js" ...>
    <testcase  ... />
...
```

The rest of this document uses Mocha as an example.


## Getting started

First, follow the steps in the [Getting started](../getting-started.md) guide to install the Launchable CLI, set your API key, and verify your connection.

Then return to this page to complete the three steps of implementation:

1. Recording builds
2. Subsetting test execution
3. Recording test results

## Recording builds

Launchable selects tests based on the changes contained in a **build**. To send metadata about changes to Launchable, run `launchable record build` before you create a build in your CI script:

```bash
launchable record build --name <BUILD NAME> --source <PATH TO SOURCE>
```

* With the `--name` option, you assign a unique identifier to this build. You will use this value later when you request a subset and record test results. See [Choosing a value for `<BUILD NAME>`](../resources/build-names.md) for tips on choosing this value.
* The `--source` option points to the local copy of the Git repository used to produce this build, such as `.` or `src`. See [Data privacy and protection](../security/data-privacy-and-protection.md) for more info.

## Subsetting tests

Subsetting instructions differ depending on whether you plan to [shift tests left](../#shift-left) or [shift tests right](../#shift-right):

### Shift left

First, set up a new test execution job/step/pipeline to run earlier in your software development lifecyle.

Then, to retrieve a subset of tests, first list all the tests you would normally run and pass that to `launchable subset`:

```bash
find ./test -name '*.js' | 
launchable subset \
    --build <BUILD NAME> \
    --target 10% \
    file > launchable-subset.txt
```

* The `--build` should use the same `<BUILD NAME>` value that you used before in `launchable record build`.
* The `--target` option should be a percentage; we suggest `20%` to start. This creates a subset of the most important tests that will run in 20% of the full execution time. As the model learns from your builds, the tests in the subset will become more and more relevant.

This creates a file called `launchable-subset.txt` that you can pass into your command to run tests:

```bash
mocha $(< launchable-subset.txt)
```

Make sure to continue running the full test suite at some stage. Run `launchable record build` and `launchable record tests` for those runs to continually train the model.

### Shift right

The [shift right](../#shift-right) diagram suggests first splitting your existing test run into two parts:

1. A subset of dynamically selected tests, and
2. The rest of the tests

To retrieve a subset of tests, first pass the full list of test candidates to `launchable subset`. For example:

```bash
find ./test -name '*.js' | 
launchable subset \
    --build <BUILD NAME> \
    --target 10% \
    --rest launchable-remainder.txt \
    file > subset.txt
```

* The `--build` should use the same `<BUILD NAME>` value that you used before in `launchable record build`.
* The `--target` option should be a percentage; we suggest `20%` to start. This creates a subset of the most important tests that will run in 20% of the full execution time. As the model learns from your builds, the tests in the subset will become more and more relevant.
* The `--rest` option writes all the other tests to a file so you can run them separately.

This creates two files called `launchable-subset.txt` and `launchable-remainder.txt` that you can pass into your command to run tests in two stages:

```bash
mocha $(< launchable-subset.txt)

mocha $(< launchable-remainder.txt)
```

You can remove the second part after we've let you know that the model is sufficiently trained. Once you do this, make sure to continue running the full test suite at some stage. Run `launchable record build` and `launchable record tests` for those runs to continually train the model.

## Recording test results

After running tests, point the CLI to your test report files to collect test results and train the model:

```bash
launchable record tests \
    --build <BUILD NAME> \
    --base . \
    file ./reports/*.xml
```

* When test reports contain absolute path names of test files, it prevents Launchable from seeing that `/home/kohsuke/ws/foo.js` from one test execution and `/home/john/src/foo.js` from another execution are actually the same test, so the `--base` option is available to relativize the test file names.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You might need to take extra steps to make sure that `launchable record tests` always runs even if the build fails. See [Always record tests](../resources/always-run.md).
