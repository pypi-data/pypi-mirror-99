SnakeEyes is a python dice library designed to be easily extensible.
***VERY MUCH WIP***

## Input
Input with snakeyes is done in form of
```
[quantity]d[sides][diceoperators][math]
```

Examples of valid input are:
```
1d20
4d6
1d20+5
(1d20+27)*16
(20+5)/12
```

## Operators
"x" - Exploding dice, used in the form:
```
[diceroll]x[threshhold]
```

Any roll in the result set, meeting or exceeding the threshold, will trigger another roll to be made. Returns the set of rolls, with the addition of any exploded rolls.

">" - Inequality, used in the form:
```
[diceroll]>[threshold]
```
Any roll which exceeds the threshold will count as a success, returns a tuple with the rolls value, combined with a bool indicating whether it exceeded the threshold.
