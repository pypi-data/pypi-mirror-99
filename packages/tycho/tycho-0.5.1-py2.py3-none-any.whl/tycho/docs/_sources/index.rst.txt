   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Tycho's documentation!
==================================================

Tycho is a service designed for durable storage and fast querying of events that indicate operational
change. Examples of such events include:

* deployments
* work-in-action (upgrading a host, network card)
* AB bucket changes

In short, any change that can affect the behavior of a service.

Once this data is in Tycho, you can perform various queries of the data such as:

* querying a single event
* querying a series of events based on tags and time ranges when the event occurred
* querying for a tree of events: if a parent-child relationship is specified in events,
  Tycho can construct a tree and return the full tree of results.

Events must contain a timestamp, and allow an optional description and
arbritrary tags that can be queried from the `API </api/>`_.

Events may also reference a parent event, which ETS can use to
generate a tree display signifying that relationship.
