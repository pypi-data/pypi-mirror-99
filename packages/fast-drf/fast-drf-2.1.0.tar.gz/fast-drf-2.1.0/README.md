## Fast DRF(Django REST Framework) [Change Log](https://github.com/iashraful/fast-drf/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
> Fast DRF is a small library for making API faster with Django and Django REST Framework.
It's easy and configurable.


### Quick Start
* Install the library inside your  virtualenv by using pip `pip install fast-drf`
* Add config for Fast DRF like following,
```python
FAST_DRF_CONFIG = {
    'DEFAULT_APPLIED_APPS': (
        'example_app', 'another_app'
    )
}
```
* Update your every model or if you use base abstract model then it's good and less time you need. Update model like following,
```python
from fast_drf.mixins.expose_api_model_mixin import ExposeApiModelMixin
from django.db import models


class MyModel(ExposeApiModelMixin, models.Model):
    #... All yor fields
    pass
    
    # The following methods are available from model mixin
    @classmethod
    def exposed_api(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        This method holds a bunch of API configs and return like following...
        {
            "api_url": "",  # (REQUIRED)

            # You must use from HTTPVerbsEnum. Like HTTPVerbsEnum.GET.value, HTTPVerbsEnum.POST.value
            "allowed_methods": ['get', 'post', 'put', 'patch', 'delete'], # (NOT REQUIRED)

            # slug_field is application 'put', 'patch', 'delete' these methods
            "slug_field": "pk", # (NOT REQUIRED) DEFAULT [PK] (Must be model field, unique or primary key)

            "queryset": "",  # (NOT REQUIRED) default all
            "viewset_class": "",  # (NOT REQUIRED) BaseViewset class
            "serializer_class": "",  # (NOT REQUIRED) default BaseEntitySerializer
            "permission_classes": "",  # (NOT REQUIRED) default set from settings
        }
        :param args:
        :param kwargs:
        :return: An empty Dictionary/False OR Full config dictionary.
        """
        api_configs = {
            "api_url": 'my-model-api',
        }
        return api_configs

```

#### Enable multiple API version
To achieve this awesomeness rewrite the following method in your model
```python
@classmethod
def api_version_fields(cls, **kwargs):
    """
    *** DEFAULT VERSION `v1` ***

    This method will return a dictionary object with version number and fields name. Fields are similar like
    serializer fields. Or you can say exactly as same as serializer fields.
    :param kwargs: Currently nothing to receive on kwargs
    :return: a dictionary object with version number
    """
    versions = {
        'v1': ['id', 'name', 'custom_1', 'custom_2'],
        'v2': ['id', 'name', 'something_else']
    }
    return versions
```


#### Append a slash at the end of of API
Set `APPEND_SLASH = True` at your settings.py

#### API Prefix Change
Set you API prefix as your own like following.  
```python
FAST_DRF_CONFIG = {
    # ...
    'DEFAULT_API_PREFIX': 'rest-api'  # Default 'api'
    # ...
}
```
Your API will look like, `/rest-api/v1/users/`


**That's it.** You can also override serializer class and viewset class
