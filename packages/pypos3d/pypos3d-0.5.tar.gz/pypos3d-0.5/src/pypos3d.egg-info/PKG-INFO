Description: This file is the README of the library pypos3d.
        
        1) INTRODUCTION:
        ================
        This library is a port of the old DATA3D library of the OpenSource Pojamas project.
        I own both of them.
        
        pypos3d aims to replace Pojamas.DATA3D library with a very close interface.
        Application ePOSER (in Eclipse RCP) is replaced by a new MMI concept based on 
        LibreOffice/Python.
        
        This Python library intends to give high level operations for some 3D files:
        - WaveFront Files (.OBJ and compressed .obz [gziped]): 
          * Read / Write
          * Groups manupilation : add, remove, optimization, fusion
          * High level method:
            Plane Split, Plane Slice, Remesh, Hole filling
        
          All Wavefront functions (classes) are in the pypos3d.wftk package
        
        - Poser Files (.PZ3, .CR2, .PZZ, .CRZ, .PP2, .PPZ):
          * Read / Write
          * Actors, Props, Cameras, ... manipulations: add, remove, rename
          * Morph report and morph report on alternate geometries
          * Cleaning
          
          All Poser functions (classes) are in the pypos3d.pftk packages
        
        Initialy, Pojamas project was a Eclipse RCP application based on a SWT/Java3D MMI. 
        For maintenance reason, this RCP application will be discontinued and shall be replaced
        by another one (cf. chapter 4 'GUI').
        
        2) INSTALLATION:
        ================
        
        2.1) Library Installation:
        -------------------------
        The library shall be installed with pip:
        > python3 -m pip pypos3d
        
        2.2) GUI Install:
        ----------------
        
          First, download the relevant GUI distribution package from Source Forge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pojamas/files/
             Filename : PyPos3DLO-X.Y.Z.zip
          Unzip it in your usual work directory (anywhere, in fact)
        
          1. On _Linux_ (and probably Mac - To Be Confirmed):
             Install first the library and its dependencies
             Launch the GUI installer : PyPos3D-App-Installer.ods
             Clic on **Check** install first and then on **Install**
             Close LibreOffice
        
             The installation is finished, you can use the PyPos3DLO.ods sheet
        
          2. On _Windows_ (and for pure LibreOffice Installation on Linux)
             You will need to extend the internal Python installation with the dependencies.
             The PyPos3dLO installer will help you.
        
             Launch the GUI installer : PyPos3D-App-Installer.ods
             Clic on **Check** install first and then on **Install**
             Close LibreOffice
        
             The installation is finished, you can use the PyPos3DLO.ods sheet as an algorithm launcher.
        
        
        2.3) 3D OpenGL Viewer Install:
        -----------------------------
        The Viewer shall be installed with pip:
        > python3 -m pip pypos3dv
        
        
        According to your system install, you may have to install some libraries:
        Pillow (>= 6.2)
        glfw (>=3)
        
        On CentOS 7: 
        > yum install python36.pillow glfw
        
        On Debian 10 (i386)
          glfw can't find the glfw3 library, because of the installation path
          apt-get install libglfw3
          export PYGLFW_LIBRARY=/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libglfw.so.3
        
        
        
        3) DESIGN:
        ==========
        The pypos3d Library has the following structure:
          * langutil : A personal generic package for some utilities
        
          * pypos3d.wftk : WaveFront manipulation package
            The main classes are pypos3d.wftk.WaveGeom and pypos3d.wftk.GeomGroup.
            Refer to WaveGeom documention for information
        
          * pypos3d.pftk : Poser files manipulation package
        
          * pypos3d.propslim : Decimation function (port of Michael Garland "SlimKit Surface Modeling Tools")
        
          * Dependencies :
            - numpy
            - scipy
            - xlrd
        
        The pypod3dv Viewer package has a flat structure:
          * Modules: Window.py and Renderable.py
          * Launcher: pypos3dv (executes __main__.py)
        
          * Dependencies :
            - pypos3d
            - PyOpenGL
            - PyGLM
            - GLFW
        
        
        4) TESTS:
        =========
        This library is tested with unitest with a target coverage rate over 85%.
        Unit tests are delivered in another package: pypos3dtu
        Coding rules are based on CNES (RNC-CNES-Q-HB-80-535) - CNES is the French National Space Agency https://www.cnes.fr -
        
        Installation and commissionning tests are performed on:
        - CentOS 8, 7
        - Fedora >30
        - Microsoft Windows 10 
        
        5) GUI:
        =======
        As mentioned previously, the former Pojamas application was an Eclipse RCP (obsolete RCP3).
        In the future, a WxPython application is forseen.
        For tests purpose, a LibreOffice calc based GUI is proposed.
        Refer to: Pojamas for download
        The GUI requires LibreOffice >= 6.4 on Windows and LibreOffice >= 6.3 on Linux (CentOS > 7)
        
        This new version of the library (>0.4) provides a simple 3d Viewer.
        
        LICENCE:
        This library is delivered under the BSD license.
