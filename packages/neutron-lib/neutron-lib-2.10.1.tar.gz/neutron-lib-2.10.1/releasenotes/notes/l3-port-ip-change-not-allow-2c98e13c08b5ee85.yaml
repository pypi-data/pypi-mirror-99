    Directly updating some L3-related port IP addresses does not have any
    effect on the L3 agent side. As a consequence, these L3-related ports
    should not allow changing of their IP address. A new shim extension has
    been added called ``l3-port-ip-change-not-allowed`` to prevent such IP
    address change. For more information please see bug
    `1796824 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1796824>`_.
