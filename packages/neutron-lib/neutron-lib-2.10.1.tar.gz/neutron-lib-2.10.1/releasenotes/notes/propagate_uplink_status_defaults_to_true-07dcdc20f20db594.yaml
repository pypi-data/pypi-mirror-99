    The API extension ``uplink-status-propagation`` has changed the default
    value of ``propagate_uplink_status`` from False to True. Now, when this
    extension is enabled, the VF link state will be set, by default, to "auto",
    following the PF link state.
    This change will affect only new ports; existing ports will keep their
    current value.
