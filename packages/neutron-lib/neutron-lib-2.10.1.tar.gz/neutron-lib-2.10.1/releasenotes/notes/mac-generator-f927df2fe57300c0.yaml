    Introduced ``neutron_lib.utils.net.random_mac_generator(basemac)``. It allows
    you to get a mac address string Python generator from the same kind of
    basemac that ``neutron_lib.utils.net.get_random_mac(basemac)`` expects. If
    there are a lot of macs to get, this will speed the process up
    significantly over generating single macs and testing for collisions.
