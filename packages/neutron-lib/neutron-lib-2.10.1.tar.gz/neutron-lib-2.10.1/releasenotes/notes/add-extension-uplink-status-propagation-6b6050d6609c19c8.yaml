    Add an API extension ``uplink-status-propagation`` to indicate if the
    server support propagating uplink status. This extension adds an attribute
    ``propagate_uplink_status`` to port. This attribute can be implemented
    for VF port. If it is set to ``True``, the VF link state can follow that
    of PF. The default is ``False`` which is the current behavior.
