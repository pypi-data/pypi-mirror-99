deprecations:

    The parameter 'remote_ip_prefix' in metering label rules has been
    deprecated. Its name expresses the opposite of what does when used,
    and the lack of documentation confuses people. Moreover, an alternative
    method has been proposed and approved to enable operators to create
    metering rules using both source and destination IP addresses.
