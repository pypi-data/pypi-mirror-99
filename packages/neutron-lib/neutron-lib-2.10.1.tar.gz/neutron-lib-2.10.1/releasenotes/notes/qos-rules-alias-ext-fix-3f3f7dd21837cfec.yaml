    The ``qos-rules-alias`` API extension wrongly attempted to re-define
    ``bandwidth_limit_rules``, ``dscp_marking_rules`` and
    ``minimum_bandwidth_rules`` as first level API resources, leading to
    conflicts in the QoS API. We now define ``alias_bandwidth_limit_rules``,
    ``alias_dscp_marking_rules`` and ``alias_minimum_bandwidth_rules`` that
    will enable users to perform ``GET``, ``PUT`` and ``DELETE`` operations
    on the corresponding QoS rules without having to specify the associated
    policy ID.
