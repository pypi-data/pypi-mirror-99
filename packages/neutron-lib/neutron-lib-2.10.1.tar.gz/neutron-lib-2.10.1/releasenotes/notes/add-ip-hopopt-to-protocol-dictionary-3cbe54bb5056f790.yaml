    ``IP`` and ``HOPOPT`` keywords were added to
    ``neutron_lib.constants.IP_PROTOCOL_MAP``.
    This allows the use of these keywords to be used when creating
    security group rules to describe either all IP protocols (for IPv4), or
    Hop-by-Hop Options (for IPv6), instead of having to use the number
    zero (0) for this purpose.
