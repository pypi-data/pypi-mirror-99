    Module ``neutron_lib.db`` is now removed from db profiling projects so
    database calls done from this module will not be tracked in osprofiler
    results.
    All db calls which are tracked by osprofiler are comming from
    Neutron and this avoids having each call logged twice in osprofiler
    report.
