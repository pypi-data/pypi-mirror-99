    Neutron API should not allow user to set zero for floating IP port
    forwarding internal or external port number. Directly modify the
    floating-ip-port-forwarding extension to change external_port and
    internal_port minimum value to 1. Then API and port forwarding object
    will make consistent for these attributes.
