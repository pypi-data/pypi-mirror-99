    neutron-lib now has a new module: ``neutron_lib.placement.utils``.
    This module contains logic that is to be shared between in-tree
    Neutron components and possibly out-of-tree Neutron agents that want
    to support features involving the Placement service (for example
    guaranteed minimum bandwidth).
