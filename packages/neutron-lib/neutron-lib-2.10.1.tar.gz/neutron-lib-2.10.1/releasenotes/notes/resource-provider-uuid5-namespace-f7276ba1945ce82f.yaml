    New MechanismDriver API class property:
    ``resource_provider_uuid5_namespace``.  Mechanism drivers wanting
    to support resource provider information reporting to Placement
    (eg. reporting resource providers to guarantee some minimum bandwidth
    allocated on them later) must set this class property to a UUID
    object unique to that mechanism driver. It will be used as a UUID
    v5 namespace in generating UUIDs for resource providers. The default
    implementation sets it to ``None``, meaning that the mechanism driver
    does not support resource provider information reporting to Placement.
    Unaffected drivers need not be changed.
