    API extension ``filter-validation`` relies on the ``is_filter`` keyword
    in the ``RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`` to judge if an attribute can be used as
    filter. Neutron plugins which want to support filter validation
    needs to set ``is_filter`` to ``True`` for each attribute in their
    resource attribute map.
