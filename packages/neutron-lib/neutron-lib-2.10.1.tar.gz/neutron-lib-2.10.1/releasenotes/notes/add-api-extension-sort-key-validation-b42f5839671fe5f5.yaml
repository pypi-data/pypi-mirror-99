    API extension ``sort-key-validation`` relies on the ``is_sort_key`` keyword
    in the ``RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_MAP`` to judge if an attribute can be used as
    sort key. Neutron plugins which want to support sort key validation
    needs to set ``is_sort_key`` to ``True`` for each attribute in their
    resource attribute map.
