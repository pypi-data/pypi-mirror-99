    A new vnic type ``vdpa`` has been added to allow requesting port that
    utilize a vhost-vdpa offload. vhost-vdpa is simpler to vhost-user or
    kernel vhost offload but utilizes the newly added vdpa bus introduced
    in the Linux 5.7 kernel. vdpa interface can be implemented in software
    or hardware, when implemented in hardware they provide equivalent
    performance to sr-iov or hardware offloaded ovs while have two main
    advantages over both sriov and hardware offloaded ovs. Unlike the alternatives
    vhost-vdpa enable live migration of instance transparently and provides
    a standard virtio-net interface to the guest avoiding the need to install
    vendor specific drivers  in the guest.
