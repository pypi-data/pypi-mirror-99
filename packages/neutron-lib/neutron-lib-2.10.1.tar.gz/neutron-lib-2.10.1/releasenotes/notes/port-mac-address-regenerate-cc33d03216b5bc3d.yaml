    Adds api extension ``port-mac-address-regenerate``. Also adds converter
    ``convert_to_mac_if_none`` used by api extenstion
    ``port-mac-address-regenerate``. When passing ``'null'`` (``None``) as the
    ``mac_address`` on port update the converter will generate a new mac
    address that will be assigned to the port.
