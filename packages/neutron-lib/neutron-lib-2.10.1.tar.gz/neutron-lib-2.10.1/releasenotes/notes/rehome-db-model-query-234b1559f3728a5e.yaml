features:
  - The public functions of ``neutron.db._model_query`` are now available in
    ``neutron_lib.db.model_query`` with the same name. While these modules can
    be used, forward looking projects should start moving to versioned objects
    and after which point we can remove this module.
  - A new fixture named ``DBQueryHooksFixture`` is provided for testing
    purposes allowing consumers to patch-out the model_query filter hooks.
  - The ``make_weak_ref`` and ``resolve_ref`` functions from neutron are now
    available in ``neutron_lib.utils.helpers``.
  - The ``TenantIdProjectIdFilterConflict`` exception is now available in
    ``neutron_lib.exceptions``.
  - The ``neutron.objects.utils`` module is now available in
    ``neutron_lib.objects.utils``.
