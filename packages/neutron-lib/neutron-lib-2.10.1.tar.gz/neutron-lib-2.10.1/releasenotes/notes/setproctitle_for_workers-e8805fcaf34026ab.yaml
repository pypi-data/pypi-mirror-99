    ``neutron_lib.worker.BaseWorker`` will now set the process title
    on process start, if it is a new process. By default, the name
    will be "neutron-server", and the description will be the name
    of the worker class, followed by the original process title.
    Both fields are customizable via the ``name`` and ``desc``
    arguments to ``BaseWorker.start()``, and the change
    can be disabled via the ``set_proctitle`` argument to the
    ``__init__`` function. ``neutron.conf`` will have a setting
    for disabling this functionality for all in-tree workers, but
    by default, all out of tree plugin workers will set their name
    at fork time. Available settings are 'on' (described above, and
    the default), 'off' (same as today), or 'brief', which settings
    the process name to just name and description. 'brief' is probably
    most useful/simple for deployers, but 'on' is the default in order
    to prevent as many script related breakages as possible.
upgrade:
  - Any plugin which forks worker processes from neutron-server will
    have its proctitle set to "neutron-server" plus a classname in ps
    output. Any tool used for monitoring/maintenance that watches
    the process table should be modified to only look for the string
    ``neutron-server``. On the plus side, it will now be possible
    to distinguish which process belongs to which plugin, based on
    the new naming. Note that the original process string is still
    in the proctitle, so as long as the scripting is not looking for
    a perfect string match, it should continue to work.
