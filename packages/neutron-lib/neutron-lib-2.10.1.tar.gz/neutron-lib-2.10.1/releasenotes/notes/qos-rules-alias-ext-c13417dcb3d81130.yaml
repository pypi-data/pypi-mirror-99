    The ``qos-rules-alias`` API extension is introduced to enable users to
    perform ``GET``, ``PUT`` and ``DELETE`` operations on
    ``bandwidth_limit_rules``, ``dscp_marking_rules`` and
    ``minimum_bandwidth_rules`` as though they are first level resources. In
    other words, the user will not have to specify the QoS policy ID.
