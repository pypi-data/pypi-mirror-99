features:
  - The ``flavors`` API definition is now available in
    ``neutron_lib.api.definitions.flavors``.
  - A new ``type:service_plugin_type`` validator has been added that
    allows a service plugin to be validated at runtime by checking
    the ``neutron_lib.plugins.directory``.
  - Exceptions related to the ``flavor`` API have been added to
    ``neutron_lib.exceptions.flavors`` except for
    ``InvalidFlavorServiceType`` which is now a generic
    ``InvalidServiceType`` in ``neutron_lib.exceptions``.
