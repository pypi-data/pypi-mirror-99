    New MechanismDriver API method: ``responsible_for_ports_allocation``.
    Mechanism drivers wanting to support resource allocations for ports in
    Placement (eg. wanting to guarantee some minimum bandwidth allocated
    on the resource provider in the port's ``binding:profile.allocation``)
    must implement this method. The default implementation reports not
    being responsible for any resource providers, therefore unaffected
    drivers need not be changed.
