    The Placement client previously swallowed a few exceptions (but logged
    a warning when doing this). In order to let the user of the client choose
    to handle or ignore the error condition the client no longer does this.
    Also to avoid losing error information we catch and re-throw HTTP 4xx
    exceptions with better messages.
