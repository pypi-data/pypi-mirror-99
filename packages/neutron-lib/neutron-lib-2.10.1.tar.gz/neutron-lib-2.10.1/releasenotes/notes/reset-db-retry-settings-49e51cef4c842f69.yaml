    Increase the DB retry interval and max retry times for the
    ``retry_db_errors`` decorator in ``neutron_lib.db.api`` to
    0.5 seconds and 20 times, respectively. For those actions
    which have a higher chance for DBDeadlock, users should have
    a higher success rate due to the larger random range and retry
    times. For more information
    see bug `1777968 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1777968>`_
