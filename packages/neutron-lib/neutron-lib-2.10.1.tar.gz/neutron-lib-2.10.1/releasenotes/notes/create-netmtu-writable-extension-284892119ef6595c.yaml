features:
  - The new ``net-mtu-writable`` extension API definition has been added as
    ``neutron_lib.api.definitions.network_mtu_writable``. The new extension
    indicates that the network ``mtu`` attribute is writeable.  Plugins
    supporting the new extension are expected to also support ``net-mtu``.
