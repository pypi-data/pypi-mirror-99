    Change create_inventory in placement client to
    update_resource_provider_inventories and update_inventory to
    update_resource_provider_inventory
issues:
  - Placement API has no POST method for creating resource provider inventories
    but instead has PUT to update the inventories of a resource provider.
  - Placement API has method to update the inventory for a given
    resource_provider.
fixes:
  - Change the method name create_inventory in clients/placement.py to
    update_resource_provider_inventories as that represents what is on the
    placement side.
  - Change the POST call to /resource_providers/{uuid}/inventories to
    PUT.
  - Change the method name update_inventory in clients/placement.py to
    update_resource_provider_inventory as that represents that the method
    updates the inventory of a resource_provider.
