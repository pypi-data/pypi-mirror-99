features:
  - The new extension ``port-resource-request`` adds the ``resource_request``
    attribute to port responses. This attribute enables Neutron to communicate
    to Nova resources needed by the port, such as physnet, VNIC type and
    bandwidth. If the port requested by Nova boot has the ``resource_request``
    attribute, then the Nova Scheduler will try to allocate the VM in a host
    that can satisfy those requirements.
