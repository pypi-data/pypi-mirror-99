    Introduced priority to callback subscription. An integer value can be
    associated with each callback so that callbacks can be executed in
    specified order for same resources and events. Every callback will have
    priority value by default. To execute callbacks in specified order, priorities
    should be defined explicitly, lower priority value would be executed first.
