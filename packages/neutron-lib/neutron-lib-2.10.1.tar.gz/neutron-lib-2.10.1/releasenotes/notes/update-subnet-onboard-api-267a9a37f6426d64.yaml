    This change removes the ``ONBOARD_SUBNETS_SPECS`` attribute extension
    from the subnet onboard extension descriptor. This has been deemed to
    be an unnecessary attribute extension during implementation and has been
    removed. Because subnet onboard is not yet a completed Neutron feature,
    the API definition is being updated to reflect this.
