    Updated fwaas API extension definition to include  previously missing
    ability to specify remote firewall groups for ingress and egress traffic.
    When a firewall group rule specifies a remote group, for example an
    ingress rule in fwgA specifies a remote group of fwgB, that means only
    packets from fwgB could match this ingress rule.
