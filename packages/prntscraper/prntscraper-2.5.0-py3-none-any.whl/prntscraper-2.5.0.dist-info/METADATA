# prntscraper

* *prntscraper* will allow you to scrape images from the prnt.sc website as they have predictable subheadings we can freely attempt to get random images or images in a sequential order from a specified amount to a max limit and download them into a folder. This process is also known as [Fuskering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusker)  This is a security issue from their end as It's highly common people store sensitive information that could easily be stolen if these images are found by the wrong people.

* **DISCLAIMER** I am not responsible for the information that may be found with this package.

print(result)

# Gets the newest images and stores them in ./images folder  || MUST HAVE CHROMEDRIVER INSTALLED TO WORK || 
my_scraper = PrntScraper()
result = my_scraper.get_random_images(newest=True)
print(result)

# Takes inputted images and stores them in ./images folder.
my_scraper = PrntScraper()
result = my_scraper.get_input_images()

     The version of **Chromedriver** must be less than or equal to your current Chrome browser version. 
    * To find your version type `chrome://version` in the search bar

Enter an End Point (inclusive) below 9999 to end: 109
