    IClientActor defines the common functionality for actors acting
    as clients of other actors (controllers and brokers). Every client actor
    is connected to one or more server actors. Each server actor is represented
    as a proxy object. Client actors maintain a registry of proxies to server
    actors that they are connected to. Proxies to actors acting in the broker
    role are explicitly managed. Proxies for actors acting in the site authority
    role are automatically managed as they are embedded in tickets sent from brokers.
