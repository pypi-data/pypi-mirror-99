    Build dependencies.

    Is used to specify packages which need to be installed in order for this package to
    install correctly.

    Most mods do not have build dependencies, however mods that require patching using
    tools external to portmod, or packages that generate content from other sources,
    will need to include their masters, or the other sources, as build dependencies,
    to ensure that they are installed prior to the package being installed.

    Format:
    A list of dependencies in the form of package atoms. All dependencies should
    include both category and package name. Versions should also be included if
    the package depends on a specific version of another mod.
    It is recommended not to include a version number in the dependency unless it is
    known that the package will not work with other versions.

    Ranges of versions can be indicated by prefixing >,<,<=,>= to the atoms.
    E.g. ``>=cat/foo-1.0``

    Use flag dependencies can be specified in the following manner:

    - ``cat/foo[flag]`` - Indicates that flag must be enabled
    - ``cat/foo[flag,flag2]`` - Indicates that both flag and flag2 must be enabled
    - ``cat/foo[!flag]`` - Indicates that flag must be disabled
    - ``cat/foo[flag?]`` - Indicates that flag must be enabled if it is enabled for
        this package
    - ``cat/foo[!flag?]`` - Indicates that flag must be disabled if it is enabled for
        this package

    Atoms can be surrounded by use-conditionals if they are only dependencies when
    that use flag is enabled/disabled.

    E.g. ``flag? ( cat/foo )``

    Atoms can be grouped and prefixed by a ``||`` operator to indicate that any of the
    given packages will satisfy the dependency.

    E.g. ``|| ( cat/foo cat/bar cat/baz )``

    Note that it is required that the parentheses ``(`` ``)`` are separated from the atoms
    by whitespace.

    Packages which cannot be installed at the same time can be marked as blocks using the
    ``!!`` operator. I.e. ``!!cat/foo`` indicates that ``cat/foo`` cannot be installed at
    the same time as the current package.
