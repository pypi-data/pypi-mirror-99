"""
Dependency resolution module

Converts mod dependency links and REQUIRED_USE conditions into a MAX-SAT formula in
conjunctive normal form.
This formula is then solved using pysat (python-sat on pypi) and the resulting model
converted back into a list of installed mods and their use flag configuration.

Note that the hard requirements defined in DEPEND, RDEPEND and REQUIRED_USE are
converted into a SAT formula that must be solved in its entirety.
We use a MAX-SAT solver because there are also other soft requirements which are used
to avoid installing mods unnecessarily and to avoid changing the user's use flag
configuration, if possible.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem for details on
the SAT problem
