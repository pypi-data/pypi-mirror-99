Description: # 🏥 Infirmary
        
        Welcome to "Infirmary", the [ReST-based](https://restfulapi.net/) [application programming interface](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api) for the [Clinical Data component](https://github.com/MCLConsortium/clinical-data) of the the [Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/). This project, along with [Sickbay](https://github.com/MCLConsortium/clinical-data/tree/master/sickbay) form a database for discovering clinical data.
        
        
        ## ⚙️ Endpoints
        
        Once deployed, this package provides the following ReST API endpoints:
        
        | Endpoint                          | Auth | Purpose                                                        |
        | :-------------------------------- | :--: | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `/ping`                           |      | Test if the server is working                                  |
        | `/hello/{greeting}`               |  🔐  | Test if authentication is working                              |
        | `/clinicalCores`                  |  🔐  | Return all Clinical Cores in the database, fully serialized    |
        | `/clinicalCores/{participant_ID}` |  🔐  | Return the single Clinical Core for the named `participant_ID` |
        | `/organs`                         |  🔐  | Return all organs in the database                              |
        | `/organs/{identifier}`            |  🔐  | Return the single organ with the numeric `identifier`          |
        | `/specimens`                      |  🔐  | Return all biospecimens in the database                        |
        | `/specimens/{specimen_ID}`        |  🔐  | Return the single biospecimen with the given `specimen_ID`     |
        | `/genomics`                       |  🔐  | Return all genomics in the database                            |
        | `/genomics/{specimen_ID}`         |  🔐  | Return the genomics information with the given `specimens_ID`  |
        | `/images`                         |  🔐  | Return all imaging information in the database                 | 
        | `/images/{identifier}`            |  🔐  | Return the imaging information with the numeric `identifier`   |
        
        For those endpoints where the "Auth" column is dispays 🔐, you must provide an HTTP Basic Authentication header with a username and password of a member of the Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions. All of the endpoints return a JSON payload.
        
        
        ## 🔧 Development
        
        To develop locally with a local Postgres database:
        
        ```console
        python3 bootstrap.py
        bin/buildout
        bin/infirmary --debug
        ```
        
        To create and register the image:
        
        ```console
        docker image build --tag mcl-infirmary:latest .
        docker image tag mcl-infirmary:latest nutjob4life/mcl-infirmary:latest
        docker login
        docker image push nutjob4life/mcl-infirmary:latest
        ```
        
        To explore the image:
        
            docker container run --rm --interactive --tty --entrypoint /bin/sh mcl-infirmary:latest
