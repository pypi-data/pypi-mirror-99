Description: 
        ``dantro``: handle, transform, and visualize hierarchically structured data
        ===========================================================================
        
        ``dantro`` – from *data* and *dentro* (Greek for *tree*) – is a Python
        package that provides a uniform interface for hierarchically structured
        and semantically heterogeneous data. It is built around three main
        features:
        
        -  **data handling:** loading heterogeneous data into a tree-like data
           structure and providing a uniform interface for it
        -  **data transformation:** performing arbitrary operations on the data,
           if necessary using lazy evaluation
        -  **data visualization:** creating a visual representation of the
           processed data
        
        Together, these stages constitute a **data processing pipeline**: an
        automated sequence of predefined, configurable operations. Akin to a
        Continuous Integration pipeline, a data processing pipeline provides a
        uniform, consistent, and easily extensible infrastructure that
        contributes to more efficient and reproducible workflows. This can be
        beneficial especially in a scientific context, for instance when
        handling data that was generated by computer simulations.
        
        ``dantro`` is meant to be *integrated* into projects and be used to set up
        such a data processing pipeline, customized to the needs of the project.
        It is designed to be **easily customizable** to the requirements of the project
        it is integrated in, even if the involved data is hierachically structured or
        semantically heterogeneous.
        Furthermore, it allows a **configuration-based specification** of all
        operations via YAML configuration files; the resulting pipeline can then be
        controlled entirely via these configuration files and without requiring
        code changes.
        
        The ``dantro`` package is **open source software** released under the
        `LGPLv3+ <(https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>`_ license.
        It was developed alongside the `Utopia project <https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/utopia/utopia>`_,
        but is an independent package.
