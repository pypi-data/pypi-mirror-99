Description: # vespy
        
        Repository for various Vestas utility functions. It can be installed via pypi,
        
            pip install vespy
        
        ## SSLError
        
        If you encounter an SSLError from within Vestas firewalls, chances are that you haven't added the proper certificates. With vespy, you can do it like this
        
        ```
        pip install certifi; pip install vespy
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can invoke the fix from within python (e.g. in your own library),
        
            from vespy import fix_ssl_error
            fix_ssl_error()
