About Salt
==========

Built on python, Salt uses simple and human-readable YAML combined with
event-driven automation to deploy and configure complex IT systems. In addition
to powering SaltStack’s powerful enterprise product suite, Salt can be found
under the hood of products from Juniper, Cisco, Cloudflare, Nutanix, SUSE, and
Tieto, to name a few.

teams to help modern business more efficiently secure and maintain all aspects

systems at any scale.

functions, SaltStack software is the answer. In addition to open source
software, such as Salt, we offer
