# Whirlpool's Sixth Sense (unofficial)

Unofficial API for Whirlpool's 6th Sense appliances.

If a command does not work, check if it works trough the app. Frequently, it also won't. 

# NOTICE

Use this at your own risk. If, by using this software, any damage is caused to your appliance, or if you get too hot because your AC got crazy and now you can't sleep, the developers of this software or the manufacturer of your appliance cannot be blamed.
