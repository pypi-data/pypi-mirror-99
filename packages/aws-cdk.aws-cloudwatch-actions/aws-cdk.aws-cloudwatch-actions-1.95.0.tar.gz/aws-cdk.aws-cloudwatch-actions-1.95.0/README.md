This library contains a set of classes which can be used as CloudWatch Alarm actions.

The currently implemented actions are: EC2 Actions, SNS Actions, Autoscaling Actions and Aplication Autoscaling Actions

## EC2 Action Example

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_cloudwatch as cw
# Alarm must be configured with an EC2 per-instance metric
alarm =
# Attach a reboot when alarm triggers
alarm.add_alarm_action(
    Ec2Action(Ec2InstanceActions.REBOOT))
```

See `@aws-cdk/aws-cloudwatch` for more information.
