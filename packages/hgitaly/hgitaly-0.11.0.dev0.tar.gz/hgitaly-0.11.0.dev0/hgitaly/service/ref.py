        This interpretation is not obvious from the comments in the proto
        file, but here's the corresponding Repository method in the Ruby
        client code::

            # Returns a RefName for a given SHA
            def ref_name_for_sha(ref_path, sha)
              raise ArgumentError, "sha can't be empty" unless sha.present?

              gitaly_ref_client.find_ref_name(sha, ref_path)
            end

        In ``gitaly_ref_client``, `sha` is mapped to ``commit_id`` while
        ``ref_path`` is mapped to ``prefix``.

        In other words, making ``commit_id`` mandatory means that the point
        is to find the refs that "contain" a given commit. Translated
        in Mercurial, that would mean:

        - find the branch/topics of the changeset, compare to the branchmap
          to filter out cases where the changeset would be ancestor of
          a closed head or a wild head not selected to be presented as the
          GitLab branch
        - find whether the changeset is ancestor of a bookmark (thankfully
          for performance, we shouldn't have many bookmarks on a typical
          Heptapod repo.

        Also, GitLab expects refs such as keeparounds and MR source heads,
        these should also be taken into account, even if it's trivial for
        Mercurial or worked around the client side.
