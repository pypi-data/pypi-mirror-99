        Load Amazon IAM data into a SQLite database
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install this tool using `pip`:
        
            $ pip install iam-to-sqlite
        
        You will also need the `aws` command-line tool. Here are [the installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) for that.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Run this tool like so:
        
            iam-to-sqlite iam.db
        
        This will create a SQLite database called `iam.db` containing the following tables:
        
        - `Groups`
        - `Policies`
        - `Users`
        - `Roles`
        
        ## Development
        
        To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
        
            cd iam-to-sqlite
            python -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Or if you are using `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv shell
        
        Now install the dependencies and tests:
        
            pip install -e '.[test]'
        
        To run the tests:
        
            pytest
