# Conductor for Maya

Maya plugin submitter for the Conductor Cloud rendering service.

## Install

**To install the latest version.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade ciomaya --target=$HOME/Conductor
```

**To install a specific version, for example 0.1.0.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall ciomaya==0.1.0 --target=$HOME/Conductor
```

**Then setup the Maya module.** 

```bash
python ~/Conductor/ciomaya/post_install.py
```

> **NOTE** An alternative is to install from the Plugins page in the [Conductor Companion app](https://docs.conductortech.com/getting_started/installation/#companion-app)

## Usage

Open the Plugin Manager and load **Conductor.py**.

Go to **Conductor->About** to check the version and other info.

To set up a render, choose **Conductor->Submitter->Create** from the **Conductor** menu. 

For detailed help, checkout the [tutorial](https://docs.conductortech.com/tutorials/maya_beta) and [reference](https://docs.conductortech.com/reference/maya_beta) documentation.


## Contributing

Clone the repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:ConductorTechnologies/ciomaya.git
cd ciomaya
```

Set up a clean virtual envirionment with Python 2.7 for development (optional).

```
python -m virtualenv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install development dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Build and install from this directory into to a convenient location for testing.
```

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt --target=$HOME/ConductorStaging

python $HOME/ConductorStaging/ciomaya/post_install.py
```

When you install from the file requirements.txt, the dependency on ciocore is specified as a local sibling of this project, meaning you can develop ciocore and ciomaya in parallel.

The post_install.py script writes the conductor.mod file to your Maya modules directory. Check the output of the command to see where this is.
