# Modes 1.0.3

Photonic mode solver with a nice interface and output.
Based on a modified version of [EMpy](https://github.com/lbolla/EMpy) and [modesolverpy](https://github.com/jtambasco/modesolverpy)

* semi-vectorial and fully vectorial options,
* simple structure drawing,
* automated data saving and plotting via Matplotlib
* some limited (at this stage) data processing (finding MFD of fundamental mode), and
* easily extensible library

The documentation for this project can be found [here](http://modes.rtfd.io).

## Examples

Take a look at the jupyter notebooks

## Installation

You can install modes via `pip install modes`
