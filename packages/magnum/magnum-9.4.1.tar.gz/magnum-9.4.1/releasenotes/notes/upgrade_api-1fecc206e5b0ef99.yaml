    Cluster upgrade API supports upgrading specific nodegroups
    in kubernetes clusters. If a user chooses a default nodegroup to
    be upgraded, then both of the default nodegroups will be upgraded
    since they are in one stack. For non-default nodegroups users are
    allowed to use only the cluster template already set in the
    cluster. This means that the cluster (default nodegroups) has to
    be upgraded on the first hand. For now, the only label that is
    taken into consideration during upgrades is the kube_tag. All
    other labels are ignored.
