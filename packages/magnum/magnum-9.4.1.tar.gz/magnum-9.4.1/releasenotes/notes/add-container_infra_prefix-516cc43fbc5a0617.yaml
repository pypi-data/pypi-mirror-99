    Prefix of all container images used in the cluster (kubernetes components,
    coredns, kubernetes-dashboard, node-exporter). For example,
    kubernetes-apiserver is pulled from
    docker.io/openstackmagnum/kubernetes-apiserver, with this label it can be
    changed to myregistry.example.com/mycloud/kubernetes-apiserver. Similarly,
    all other components used in the cluster will be prefixed with this label,
    which assumes an operator has cloned all expected images in
    myregistry.example.com/mycloud.
