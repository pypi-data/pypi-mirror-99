    Magnum now support policy in code [1], which means if users didn't modify
    any of policy rules, they can leave policy file (in `json` or `yaml`
    format) empty or just remove it all together. Because from now, Magnum
    keeps all default policies under `magnum/common/policies` module. Users can
    still modify/generate the policy rules they want in the `policy.yaml` or
    `policy.json` file which will override the default policy rules in code
    only if those rules show in the policy file.
