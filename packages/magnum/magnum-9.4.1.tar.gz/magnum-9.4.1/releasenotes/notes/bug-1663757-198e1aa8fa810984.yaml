    [`bug 1663757 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/magnum/+bug/1663757>`_]
    A configuration parameter, verify_ca, was added to magnum.conf
    with a default value of True and passed to the heat templates to indicate
    whether the cluster nodes validate the Certificate Authority when making
    requests to the OpenStack APIs (Keystone, Magnum, Heat).  This parameter
    can be set to False to disable CA validation if you have self-signed
    certificates for the OpenStack APIs or you have your own Certificate
    Authority and you have not installed the Certificate Authority to all
    nodes.
