    With the new config option keystone_auth_default_policy, cloud admin
    can set a default keystone auth policy for k8s cluster when the
    keystone auth is enabled. As a result, user can use their current
    keystone user to access k8s cluster as long as they're assigned
    correct roles, and they will get the pre-defined permissions
    defined by the cloud provider.
