deprecations:
  - |
    Currently, Magnum is running periodic tasks to collect k8s cluster
    metrics to message bus. Unfortunately, it's collecting pods info
    only from "default" namespace which makes this function useless.
    What's more, even Magnum can get all pods from all namespaces, it
    doesn't make much sense to keep this function in Magnum. Because
    operators only care about the health of cluster nodes. If they
    want to know the status of pods, they can use heapster or other
    tools to get that. So the feauture is being deprecated now and will be
    removed in Stein release. And the default value is changed to False, which
    means won't send the metrics.
