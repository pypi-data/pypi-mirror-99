    Fix bug #1758672 [1] to protect kubelet in the k8s_fedora_atomic driver.
    Before this patch kubelet was listening to 0.0.0.0 and for clusters with
    floating IPs the kubelet was exposed. Also, even on clusters without fips
    the kubelet was exposed inside the cluster. This patch allows access to
    the kubelet only over https and with the appropriate roles. The apiserver
    and heapster have the appropriate roles to access it. Finally, all
    read-only ports have been closed to not expose any cluster data. The only
    remaining open ports without authentication are for healthz.
