upgrade:
  - The etcd service for Kubernetes cluster is no longer allocated a floating
    IP.
features:
  - A new label named ``master_lb_floating_ip_enabled`` is introduced which
    controls if Magnum allocates floating IP for the load balancer of master
    nodes. This label only takes effect when the ``master_lb_enabled`` is set.
    The default value is the same as ``floating_ip_enabled``. The
    ``floating_ip_enabled`` property now only controls if Magnum should
    allocate the floating IPs for the master and worker nodes.
