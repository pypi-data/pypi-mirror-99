security:
  - |
    Defines more strict security group rules for kubernetes worker nodes. The
    ports that are open by default: default port range(30000-32767) for
    external service ports; kubelet healthcheck port; Calico BGP network ports;
    flannel overlay network ports. The cluster admin should manually config the
    security group on the nodes where Traefik is allowed. To allow traffic to
    the default ports (80, 443) that the traefik ingress controller exposes
    users will need to create additional rules or expose traefik with a
    kubernetes service with type: LoadBalaner. Finally, the ssh port in worker
    nodes is closed as well. If ssh access is required, users will need to
    create a rule for port 22 as well.
