    This release introduces 'federations' endpoint
    to Magnum API, which allows an admin to create
    and manage federations of clusters through Magnum.
    As the feature is still under development, 
    the endpoints are not bound to any driver yet.
    For more details, please refer to bp/federation-api [1].
