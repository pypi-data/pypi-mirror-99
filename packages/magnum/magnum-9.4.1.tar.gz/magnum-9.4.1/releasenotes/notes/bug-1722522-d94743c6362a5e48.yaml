features:
  - |
    Allow any value to be passed on the docker_storage_driver field by turning it
    into a StringField (was EnumField), and remove the constraints limiting the
    values to 'devicemapper' and 'overlay'.
upgrade:
  - |
    Requires a db upgrade to change the docker_storage_driver
    field to be a string instead of an enum.
