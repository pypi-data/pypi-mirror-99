    Magnums onlys has one server group for all master and worker nodes
    per cluster, which is not very flexible for small cloud scale. For a
    3+ master clusters, it's easily meeting the capacity when using hard
    anti-affinity policy. Now one server group is added for each
    master and worker nodes group to have better flexibility.
