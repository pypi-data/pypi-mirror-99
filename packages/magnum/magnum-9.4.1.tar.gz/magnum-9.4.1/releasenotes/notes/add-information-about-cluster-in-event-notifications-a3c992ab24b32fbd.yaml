    Add information about the cluster in magnum event notifications.
    Previously the CADF notification's target ID was randomly generated and
    no other relevant info about the cluster was sent. Cluster details are
    now included in the notifications. This is useful for other OpenStack
    projects like Searchlight or third party projects that cache information
    regarding OpenStack objects or have custom actions running on
    notification. Caching systems can now efficiently update one single
    object (e.g. cluster), while without notifications they need to
    periodically retrieve object list, which is inefficient.
