    Now an OpenStack driver for Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler is being
    proposed to support autoscaling when running k8s cluster on top of
    OpenStack. However, currently there is no way in Magnum to let
    the external consumer to control which node will be removed. The
    alternative option is calling Heat API directly but obviously it
    is not the best solution and it's confusing k8s community. So this
    new API is being added into Magnum: POST <ClusterID>/actions/resize
