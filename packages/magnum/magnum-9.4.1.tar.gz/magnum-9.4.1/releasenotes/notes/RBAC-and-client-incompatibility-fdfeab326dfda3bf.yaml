    k8s_fedora_atomic clusters are deployed with RBAC support. Along with RBAC
    Node authorization is added so the appropriate certificates are generated.
upgrade:
  - |
    Using the queens (>=2.9.0) python-magnumclient, when a user executes
    openstack coe cluster config, the client certificate has admin as Common
    Name (CN) and system:masters for Organization which are required for
    authorization with RBAC enabled clusters. This change in the client is
    backwards compatible, so old clusters (without RBAC enabled) can be
    reached with certificates generated by the new client. However, old
    magnum clients will generate certificates that will not be able to contact
    RBAC enabled clusters. This issue affects only k8s_fedora_atomic clusters
    and clients <=2.8.0, note that 2.8.0 is still a queens release but only
    2.9.0 includes the relevant patch. Finally, users can always generate and
    sign the certificates using this [0] procedure even with old clients since
    only the cluster config command is affected.
