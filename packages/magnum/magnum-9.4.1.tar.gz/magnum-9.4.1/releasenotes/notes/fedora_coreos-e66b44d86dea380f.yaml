features:
  - |
    Add fedora coreos driver. To deploy clusters with fedora coreos operators
    or users need to add os_distro=fedora-coreos to the image. The scripts
    to deploy kubernetes on top are the same with fedora atomic. Note that
    this driver has selinux enabled.
issues:
  - |
    The startup of the heat-container-agent uses a workaround to copy the
    SoftwareDeployment credentials to /var/lib/cloud/data/cfn-init-data.
    The fedora coreos driver requires heat train to support ignition.
fixes:
  - |
    For k8s_coreos set REQUESTS_CA for heat-agent. The heat-agent as a python
    service needs to use the ca bundle of the host.
