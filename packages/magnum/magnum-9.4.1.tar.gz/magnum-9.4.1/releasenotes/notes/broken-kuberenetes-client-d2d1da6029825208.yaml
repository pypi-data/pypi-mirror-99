    Kubernetes client is incompatible with evenlet and breaks the periodic
    tasks. After kubernetes client 4.0.0 magnum is affected by the bug
    below.
    https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/147
    Magnum has three periodic tasks, one to sync the magnum service, one to
    update the cluster status and one send cluster metrics The send_metrics
    task uses the kubernetes client for kubernetes clusters and it crashes
    the sync_cluster_status and send_cluster_metrics tasks.
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/magnum/+bug/1746510
    Additionally, the kubernetes scale manager needs to be disabled
    to not break the scale down command completely. Note, that when magnum
    scales down the cluster will pick the nodes to scale randomly.

upgrade:
  - |
    In magnum configuration, in [drivers] set send_cluster_metrics = False to
    to avoid collecting metrics using the kubernetes client which crashes the
    periodic tasks.
