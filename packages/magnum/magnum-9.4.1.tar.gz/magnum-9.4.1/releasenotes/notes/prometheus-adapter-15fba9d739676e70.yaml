    Added custom.metrics.k8s.io API installer by means of stable/prometheus-adapter
    helm chart. The label prometheus_adapter_enabled (default: true) controls
    configuration. You can also use prometheus_adapter_chart_tag to select helm
    chart version, and prometheus_adapter_configmap if you would like to setup
    your own metrics (specifying this other than default overwrites default
    configurations).
    This feature requires the usage of label monitoring_enabled=true.
