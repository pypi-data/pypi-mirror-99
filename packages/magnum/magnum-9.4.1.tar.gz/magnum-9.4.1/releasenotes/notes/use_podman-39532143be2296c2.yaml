    Choose whether system containers etcd, kubernetes and the heat-agent will
    be installed with podman or atomic. This label is relevant for
    k8s_fedora drivers.

    k8s_fedora_atomic_v1 defaults to use_podman=false, meaning atomic will be
    used pulling containers from docker.io/openstackmagnum. use_podman=true
    is accepted as well, which will pull containers by k8s.gcr.io.

    k8s_fedora_coreos_v1 defaults and accepts only use_podman=true.

    Note that, to use kubernetes version greater or equal to v1.16.0 with the
    k8s_fedora_atomic_v1 driver, you need to set use_podman=true. This is
    necessary since v1.16 dropped the --containerized flag in kubelet.

    core-podman Mount os-release properly To display the node OS-IMAGE in k8s
    properly we need to mount /usr/lib/os-release, /ets/os-release is just a
    symlink.
