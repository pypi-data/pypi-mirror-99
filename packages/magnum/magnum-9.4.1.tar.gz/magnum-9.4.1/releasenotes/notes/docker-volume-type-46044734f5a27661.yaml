    A new section is created in magnum.conf named cinder. In this cinder
    section, you need to set a value for the key default_docker_volume_type,
    which should be a valid type for cinder volumes in your cinder deployment.
    This default value will be used if no volume_type is provided by the user
    when using a cinder volume for container storage. The suggested default
    value the one set in cinder.conf of your cinder deployment.
