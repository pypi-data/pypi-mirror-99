    Multi master deployments for k8s driver use different service account
    keys for each api/controller manager server which leads to 401 errors
    for service accounts. This patch will create a signed cert and private key
    for k8s service account keys explicitly, dedicatedly for the k8s
    cluster to avoid the inconsistent keys issue.
