    Includes a monitoring stack based on cAdvisor, node-exporter, Prometheus
    and Grafana. Users can enable this stack through the label
    prometheus_monitoring. Prometheus scrapes metrics from the Kubernetes
    cluster and then serves them to Grafana through Grafana's Prometheus
    data source. Upon completion, a default Grafana dashboard is provided.
