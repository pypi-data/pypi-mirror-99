    k8s_fedora Remove cluster role from the kubernetes-dashboard account. When
    accessing the dashboard and skip authentication, users login with the
    kunernetes-dashboard service account, if that service account has the
    cluster role, users have admin access without authentication. Create an
    admin service account for this use case and others.
