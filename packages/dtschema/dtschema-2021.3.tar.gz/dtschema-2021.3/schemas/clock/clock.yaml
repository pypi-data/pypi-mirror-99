description: |
  Sources of clock signal can be represented by any node in the device
  tree.  Those nodes are designated as clock providers.  Clock consumer
  nodes use a phandle and clock specifier pair to connect clock provider
  outputs to clock inputs.  Similar to the gpio specifiers, a clock
  specifier is an array of zero, one or more cells identifying the clock
  output on a device.  The length of a clock specifier is defined by the
  value of a #clock-cells property in the clock provider node.

  # Provider properties
  "#clock-cells":
    description: Number of cells in a clock specifier; Typically 0 for
      nodes with a single clock output and 1 for nodes with multiple clock
      outputs.

  clock-output-names:
    description: |
      Recommended to be a list of strings of clock output signal
      names indexed by the first cell in the clock specifier.
      However, the meaning of clock-output-names is domain
      specific to the clock provider, and is only provided to
      encourage using the same meaning for the majority of clock
      providers.  This format may not work for clock providers
      using a complex clock specifier format.  In those cases it
      is recommended to omit this property and create a binding
      specific names property.

      Clock consumer nodes must never directly reference
      the provider\'s clock-output-names property.

  clock-indices:
    $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array"
    description: If the identifying number for the clocks in the node
      is not linear from zero, then this allows the mapping of identifiers
      into the clock-output-names array.

      - $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array"
    description: |
      List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair
      for each clock input to the device.  Note: if the
      clock provider specifies '0' for #clock-cells, then
      only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.

  clock-names:
    $ref: "/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string-array"
    description: List of clock input name strings sorted in the same order
      as the clocks property.  Consumers drivers will use clock-names
      to match clock input names with clocks specifiers.

  clock-ranges:
    type: boolean
    description: Empty property indicating that child nodes can inherit
      named clocks from this node. Useful for bus nodes to provide a clock
      to their children.
