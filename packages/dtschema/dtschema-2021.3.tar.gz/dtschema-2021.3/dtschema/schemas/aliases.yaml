title: /aliases Node
description: |
  A devicetree may have an aliases node (``/aliases``) that defines one or more
  alias properties.
  The aliases node shall be at the root of the devicetree and have the node name
  ``/aliases``.

  Each property of the ``/aliases`` node defines an alias,
  which can be used as a shorthand name for a node in the tree.
  The property name is the alias name, and the property value contains the full
  path to a node encoded as a string.
  For example, the property ``serial0 = "/simple-bus@fe000000/serial@11c500";``
  defines the alias ``serial0``.

  An alias name must be a lowercase text string of 1 to 31 characters from the
  following character set.

     0-9       digit
     a-z       lowercase letter
     \-        dash
     ========= ================

  A client program may use an alias property name to refer to a full
  device path as all or part of its string value. A client program, when
  considering a string as a device path, shall detect and use the alias.
