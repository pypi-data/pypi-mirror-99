# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate HTML output
# The default value is: YES.

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java or
# Python sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored
# for that language. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages,
# qualified scopes will look different, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA   = YES

# The FILTER_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify filters on a per file pattern
# basis. Doxygen will compare the file name with each pattern and apply the
# filter if there is a match. The filters are a list of the form: pattern=filter
# (like *.cpp=my_cpp_filter). See INPUT_FILTER for further information on how
# filters are used. If the FILTER_PATTERNS tag is empty or if none of the
# patterns match the file name, INPUT_FILTER is applied.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# properly processed by doxygen.
