Description: # Overview
        
        [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is awesome, but the documentation pages (Swagger or Redoc) all depend on external CDNs, which is problematic if you want to run on disconnected networks.
        
        This package includes the required files from the CDN and serves them locally.  It also provides a super-simple way to get a FastAPI instance configured to use those files.
        
        Under the hood, this simply automates the process described in the official documentation [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/extending-openapi/#self-hosting-javascript-and-css-for-docs).
        
        # Installation
        
        You can install this package from PyPi:
        
        ```bash
        pip install fastapi-offline
        ```
        
        # Example
        
        Given the example from the [FastAPI tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/):
        
        ```python
        from fastapi import FastAPI
        
        app = FastAPI()
        
        
        @app.get("/")
        async def root():
            return {"message": "Hello World"}
        ```
        
        Simply create a `fastapi_offline.FastAPIOffline` object instead:
        
        ```python
        from fastapi_offline import FastAPIOffline
        
        app = FastAPIOffline()
        
        
        @app.get("/")
        async def root():
            return {"message": "Hello World"}
        ```
        
        Any options passed to FastAPIOffline() except `docs_url` and `redoc_url` are passed through to FastAPI.
