     ## YAML usage

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   environment:
     >>>   connections:
     >>>   volumes:
     >>>   init:
     >>>   sidecars:
     >>>   container:
     >>>   ports:
     >>>   rewritePath:
     ```

     ## Python usage

     ```python
     >>> from polyaxon.polyflow import V1Environment, V1Init, V1Service
     >>> from polyaxon.k8s import k8s_schemas
     >>> service = V1Service(
     >>>     environment=V1Environment(...),
     >>>     connections=["connection-name1"],
     >>>     volumes=[k8s_schemas.V1Volume(...)],
     >>>     init=[V1Init(...)],
     >>>     sidecars=[k8s_schemas.V1Container(...)],
     >>>     container=k8s_schemas.V1Container(...),
     >>>     ports=[6006],
     >>>     rewritePath=True,
     >>> )
     ```

     ## Fields

     ### kind

     The kind signals to the CLI, client, and other tools that this component's runtime is a service.

     If you are using the python client to create the runtime,
     this field is not required and is set by default.

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     ```

     ### environment

     Optional [environment section](/docs/core/specification/environment/),
     it provides a way to inject pod related information.

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   environment:
     >>>     labels:
     >>>        key1: "label1"
     >>>        key2: "label2"
     >>>      annotations:
     >>>        key1: "value1"
     >>>        key2: "value2"
     >>>      nodeSelector:
     >>>        node_label: node_value
     >>>      ...
     >>>  ...
     ```

     ### connections

     A list of [connection names](/docs/setup/connections/) to resolve for the service.

     <blockquote class="light">
     If you are referencing a connection it must be configured.
     All referenced connections will be checked:

      * If they are accessible in the context of the project of this run

      * If the user running the operation can have access to those connections
     </blockquote>

     After checks, the connections will be resolved and inject any volumes, secrets, configMaps,
     environment variables for your main container to function correctly.

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   connections: [connection1, connection2]
     ```

     ### volumes

     A list of [Kubernetes Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)
     to resolve and mount for your services.

     This is an advanced use-case where configuring a connection is not an option.

     When you add a volume you need to mount it manually to your container(s).

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   volumes:
     >>>     - name: volume1
     >>>       persistentVolumeClaim:
     >>>         claimName: pvc1
     >>>   ...
     >>>   container:
     >>>     name: myapp-container
     >>>     image: busybox:1.28
     >>>     command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo custom init container']
     >>>     volumeMounts:
     >>>     - name: volume1
     >>>       mountPath: /mnt/vol/path
     ```

     ### init

     A list of [init handlers and containers](/docs/core/specification/init/)
     to resolve for the service.

    <blockquote class="light">
     If you are referencing a connection it must be configured.
     All referenced connections will be checked:

      * If they are accessible in the context of the project of this run

      * If the user running the operation can have access to those connections
     </blockquote>

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   init:
     >>>     - artifacts:
     >>>         dirs: ["path/on/the/default/artifacts/store"]
     >>>     - connection: gcs-large-datasets
     >>>       artifacts:
     >>>         dirs: ["data"]
     >>>       container:
     >>>         resources:
     >>>           requests:
     >>>             memory: "256Mi"
     >>>             cpu: "500m"
     >>>     - container:
     >>>       name: myapp-container
     >>>       image: busybox:1.28
     >>>       command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo custom init container']
     ```

     ### sidecars


     A list of [sidecar containers](/docs/core/specification/sidecars/)
     that will used as sidecars.

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   sidecars:
     >>>     - name: sidecar2
     >>>       image: busybox:1.28
     >>>       command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo sidecar2']
     >>>     - name: sidecar1
     >>>       image: busybox:1.28
     >>>       command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo sidecar1']
     >>>       resources:
     >>>         requests:
     >>>           memory: "128Mi"
     >>>           cpu: "500m"
     ```

     ### container

     The [main Kubernetes Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/)
     that will run your experiment training or data processing logic.

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   container:
     >>>     name: tensorflow:2.1
     >>>     init:
     >>>       - connection: my-tf-code-repo
     >>>     command: ["python", "/plx-context/artifacts/my-tf-code-repo/model.py"]
     ```

     ### ports

     The ports to expose for your service.

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   ports: [6006]
     ```

     ### rewritePath

     By default, Polyaxon exposes services with a base url following this pattern:
      `/services/v1/test/user/project/runs/uuid`

     This default behavior works very well for Tensorboards and Notebooks,
     but if you are exposing an API that doesn't handle base urls, you can enable
     this option to rewrite the path and remove that part.

     ```yaml
     >>> run:
     >>>   kind: service
     >>>   rewritePath: true
     ```
