Installation
============

If you are (relatively) new to installing python packages, please jump to the
getting started tutorial (:doc:`Tutorials/getting_started_tutorial`)
for an opinionated step-by-step procedure.

Stable release
--------------

The preferred way to install ``cellpy`` is by using conda:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install cellpy --channel conda-forge


This will also install all of the dependencies, as well as ``jupyter``
that comes in handy when working with ``cellpy``.

If you would like to install only ``cellpy``, you should install using pip.
You also need to take into account that ``cellpy`` uses several packages
that are a bit cumbersome to install on
windows. It is therefore recommended to install one of the ``anaconda``
python packages (python 3.6 or above) before installing ``cellpy``.
If you chose ``miniconda``, you should install
``scipy``, ``numpy`` and ``pytables`` using ``conda``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install scipy numpy pytables


Then install ``cellpy``, by running this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install cellpy


You can install pre-releases by adding the ``--pre`` flag.

If you are on Windows and plan to work with Arbin files,
we recommend that you try to install `pyodbc`_ (Python ODBC bridge).
Either by using pip or from conda-forge:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyodbc

or:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c conda-forge pyodbc

.. _pyodbc: https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/


If this is the first time you install ``cellpy``, it is recommended
that you run the setup script:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cellpy setup -i

This will install a ``.cellpy_prms_USER.conf`` file in your home directory
(USER = your user name) for posix systems and the documents folder in windows.
Feel free to edit this to fit your needs.

(It is probably best to run the command also if you are upgrading ``cellpy``)

You can restore your prms-file by running ``cellpy setup`` if needed
(*i.e.* get a copy of the default file
copied to your user folder).

.. note:: Since Arbin (at least some versions) uses access database files, you
    will need to install ``pyodbc``, a python ODBC bridge that can talk to database
    files. On windows, at least if you donÂ´t have a newer version of office 365,
    you  most likely need to use Microsoft's dll for handling access
    database formats, and you might run into 32bit *vs.* 64bit issues.
    The simplest solution is to have the same "bit" for python and
    the access dll (or office). More advanced options are explained in more details
    in the getting-started tutorial. For Posix-type systems, you will need to download
    and install ``mdbtools``. If you are on Windows and you cannot get your
    ``pyodbc`` to work, you can try the same there also (search for Windows
    binaries and set the appropriate settings in your ``cellpy`` config file).


From sources
------------

The sources for ``cellpy`` can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can clone the public repository by:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/jepegit/cellpy


Once you have a copy of the source, you can install in development
mode using pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .

(assuming that you are in the project folder, *i. e.* the folder that
contains the setup.py file)
