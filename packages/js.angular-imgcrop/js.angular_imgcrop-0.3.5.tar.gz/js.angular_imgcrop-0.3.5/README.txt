js.angular_imgcrop
******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `ngImgCrop`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`ngImgCrop`: https://github.com/minddistrict/ngImgCropFullExtended

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.angular_imgcrop``) are published to some URL.

*The upstream software is no longer maintenained.*
