### A CLI based Script tool to create CPP files for programming contests

In times of contests, one has to create a CPP file, type code in it, test the cases, find the errors etc. Some times, it'd be really hectic to create files and start. But how about a tool to generate a directory which has all the files you need?? ;)

#### CODEIt eases this problem by creating the directory which has all files in it

**C++ template is only added for now, more to come in future!**

## Installation (for users)
- Make sure you've installed Python 3 in you system, if not do it first.
- Then type the following commands...
  - `pip install clint`
  - `pip install watchdog`
- Then finally type `pip install cxit` (package is still codeit but renamed to avoid conflicts)
- Type `codeit` and you're good to go!

## Installation (for developers)
- To install type `git clone https://github.com/Arch2x/codeit` to clone the repo into your system
- Next, go to the folder by using the `cd` command or directly use `bash` or `cmd` on the file path of repo
- Then type `pip install setuptools`
- Finally, type `pip install .`
- Wait for sometime until the script finishes installing necessary packages
- Then, voila! Type `codeit` to start!
