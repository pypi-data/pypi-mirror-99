        # Mod9 ASR Python Wrappers
        
        By default, requests to the Mod9 ASR Engine TCPServer must be through a TCP socket.
        The *Mod9 ASR Python wrappers*  are a set of wrappers for the Engine that provide another interface.
        
        Included are a fully-compatible drop-in replacement for the
        [Google Cloud STT Python Client Library](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/libraries#client-libraries-install-python),
        as well as for the
        [Google Cloud STT REST API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rest).
        
        For tutorials, please refer to the documentation at
        [mod9.io/python-sdk](https://mod9.io/python-sdk)
        and
        [mod9.io/rest-api](https://mod9.io/rest-api),
        respectively.
        
        There are a few methods to install the Mod9 ASR Python Wrappers.
        To install the Mod9 ASR Python wrappers using PyPI, use
        ```
        pip3 install mod9-asr
        ```
        which will retrieve the necessary files from PyPI and install.
        
        Alternatively, if you have the source code, you can navigate to the
        `wrappers/python/` directory containing the `setup.py` file
        and run
        ```
        pip3 install .
        ```
