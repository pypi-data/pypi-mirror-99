features:
  - |
    Tasks can now be configured to required a user to be authenticated when an
    Adjutant token is submitted for the final phase of a task. Actions will now
    be passed the ``keystone_user`` who submitted the token to do any processing
    on that as needed for the final step.
deprecations:
  - |
    All actions now need to have ``keystone_user`` as a second optional
    paramater in the ``submit``function. It should have a default of ``None``,
    set as ``keystone_user=None``. Any existing actions without this will continue
    to work with a fallback, but that fallback will be removed in the W release
    cycle.
