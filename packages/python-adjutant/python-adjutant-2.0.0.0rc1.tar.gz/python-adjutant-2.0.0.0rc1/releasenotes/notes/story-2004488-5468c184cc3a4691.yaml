features:
  - |
    Adjutant's config system is now built on top of CONFspirator, which is
    a config definition library like oslo.config but tailored specifically
    for some use-cases that Adjutant has.
upgrade:
  - |
    An almost entirely different config format will need to be used, but
    there will be a better feedback from the service during startup
    regarding the validity of the config. An example is present in
    `etc/adjutant.yaml` but a new one can be generated by using
    `tox -e venv adjutant-api exampleconfig`.
