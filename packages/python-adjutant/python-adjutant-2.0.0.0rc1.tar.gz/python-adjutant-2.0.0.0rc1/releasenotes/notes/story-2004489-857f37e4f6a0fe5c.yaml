    Adjutant now introduces two new concepts for handling the configurable
    APIs and workflow layer. DelegateAPIs are now the APIs which can be
    customised and enabled in Adjutant, and Tasks are now their own layer
    which can be called from the DelegateAPIs.
upgrade:
  - |
    * Major changes internal classes. Many plugins likely to need reworking
      before using this release to match new internal changes.
    * The Task database model has been renamed and moved, this will require
      downtime for the migration to run, but should be fairly quick.
deprecations:
  - |
    * TaskViews are gone, and replaced with DelegateAPIs, with much of their old
      logic now in the TaskManager and BaseTask.
    * tasks config cannot override default_actions anymore
    * standardized task API response codes on 202 unless task is completed from 200
    * Action stages renamed to 'prepare', 'approve', 'submit'.
    * TaskView logic and task defition moved to new task.v1 layer
    * UserSetPassword API has been removed because it was a duplicate of
      UserResetPassword.
    * Removed redundant ip_address value on Task model
    * multiple task_types have been renamed
      * signup to create_project_and_user
      * invite_user to invite_user_to_project
      * reset_password to reset_user_password
      * edit_user to edit_user_roles
      * update_email to update_user_email
