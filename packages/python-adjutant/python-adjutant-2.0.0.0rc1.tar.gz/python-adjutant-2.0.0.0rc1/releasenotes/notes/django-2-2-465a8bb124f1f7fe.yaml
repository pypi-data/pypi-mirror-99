upgrade:
  - |
    Adjutant will now officially only support Python3.6 onwards, and will
    start introducing features only applicable to that version onwards.
deprecations:
  - |
    Python2 support has been officially deprecated. The code may still be
    compatible for a bit longer, but we are also switching to Django 2.2,
    and python2 can no longer be tested. Support for Python less than 3.6
    has also been deprecated, but may still work for older python3 versions
    for a little longer, although not officially.
