features:
  - |
    Feature sets have been introduced, allowing Adjutant's plugins to be
    registered via entrypoints, so all that is required to include them
    is to install them in the same environment. Then which DelegateAPIs
    are enabled from the feature sets is still controlled by
    ``adjutant.api.active_delegate_apis``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Plugins that want to work with Adjutant will need to be upgraded to use
    the new feature set pattern for registrations of Actions, Tasks, DelegateAPIs,
    and NotificationHandlers.
deprecations:
  - |
    Adjutant's plugin mechanism has entirely changed, making many plugins
    imcompatible until updated to match the new plugin mechanism.
