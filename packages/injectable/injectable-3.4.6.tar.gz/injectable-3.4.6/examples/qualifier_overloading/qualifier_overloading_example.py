"""
In this example you'll learn about overloading qualifiers/classes for injection and how
to take advantage of that to inject multiple dependencies as a list of instances.

Overloading happens when two or more injectables are declared for a same qualifier
or class.

In this example we create a abstract base class ``SenderService`` and implement it in
other three classes, ``EmailSenderService``, ``SmsSenderService``, and
``FaxSenderService``. All the three concrete services are declared as injectables and
as injection declared class propagates to base classes we end up with three injectables
declared for the ``SenderService`` class.

In our ``QualifierOverloading`` example class we inject a list with all injectables
declared for the ``SenderService`` by using the :class:`typing.List` type. We also use
the ``exclude_groups`` parameter to filter out injectables that were declared with the
``"old"`` group label.

.. seealso::

    The :ref:`dependencies_precedence_example` shows how dependency resolution works in
    regards to precedence when a qualifier or class are resolved by multiple
    injectables and you're injecting a single instance and not all matching injectables.
