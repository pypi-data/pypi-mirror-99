    """
    The Result data structure represents the result of a computation. It has
    3 possible cases:

    - *Ok(some_value: A)*
            The computation succeeded.
            The value some_value, of type A, is the result of the computation
    - *Error(some_error: E)*
            The computation failed with an expected error.
            The error some_error, of type E, is the expected error encountered.
    - *Panic(some_exception: Exception)*
            The computation failed on an unexpected error.
            The exception some_exception is the unexpected error encountered.

    The distinction between errors (expected failures) and panics (unexpected
    failures) is essential.

    Errors are failures your program is prepared to deal with safely. An error
    simply means some operation was not successful, but your program is still
    behaving nicely. Nothing terribly wrong happened. Generally errors belong to
    your business domain. You can take any type as E.

    Panics, on the contrary, are failures you never expected. Your computation
    can not progress further. All you can do when panics occur, is stopping your
    computation gracefully (like releasing resources before dying). The panic type
    is always Exception.

    As an example, if your program is an HTTP server. Errors are bad requests
    (error code 400) while panics are internal server errors (error code 500).
    Receiving bad request is part of the normal life of any HTTP server, it must
    know how to reply nicely. But internal server errors are bugs.
