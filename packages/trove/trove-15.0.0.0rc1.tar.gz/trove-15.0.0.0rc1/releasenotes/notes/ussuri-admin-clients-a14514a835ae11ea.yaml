    Trove is now using admin clients by default to communicate with Nova,
    Cinder, Neutron and Glance. Deployers want to stick to the old clients need
    to explicitly config the following options:

    * remote_nova_client
    * remote_cinder_client
    * remote_neutron_client
    * remote_glance_client
