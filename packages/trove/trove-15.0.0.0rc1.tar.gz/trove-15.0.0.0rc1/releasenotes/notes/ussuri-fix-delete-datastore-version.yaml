fixes:
  - Fixed the issue that datastore version cannot be deleted because of
    dependency of deleted instances. Now, when instance or backup is
    deleted, the datastore version attribute is set to NULL in database.
    When datastore configuration parameter is deleted, the record is
    deleted from database rather than only set 'deleted' field to 1.
