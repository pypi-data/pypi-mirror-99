features:
  - Database service (mysql and mariadb) is now running as docker container
    inside the trove instance. The image is defined by ``docker_image`` config
    option for each datastore.
  - The database backup and restore operations are performed by docker
    container inside the trove instance.
  - Only one trove guest image is needed for all the datastores.
upgrade:
  - Existing database services are not affected. However, in order for
    Trove to communicate with trove guest agent, new guest image needs to be
    built and existing trove instances need to be backed up and restored.
deprecations:
  - Most of the options related to backup and restore are removed, e.g.
    backup_namespace, restore_namespace, backup_incremental_strategy
