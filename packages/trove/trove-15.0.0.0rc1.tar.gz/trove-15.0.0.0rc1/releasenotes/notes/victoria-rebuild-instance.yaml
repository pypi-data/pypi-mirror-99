features:
  - Support db instance rebuild. The rebuild operation is mainly for Trove
    upgrade, especially when the interface between Trove controller and guest
    agent changes. After Trove controller is upgraded, the cloud administrator
    needs to send rebuild request with the new guest image ID. Communication
    with the end users is needed as the database service is offline during the
    process. User's data in the database is not affected.
