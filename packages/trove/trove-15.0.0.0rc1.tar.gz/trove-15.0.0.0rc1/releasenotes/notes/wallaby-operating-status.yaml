features:
  - Added a new field ``operating_status`` for the instance to show the actual
    operational status of user's database. See
    https://docs.openstack.org/trove/latest/user/instance-status.html for more
    information.
upgrade:
  - Any 3rd party clients that are talking with Trove API to wait for
    ``status`` should be notified to use ``operating_status`` instead.
