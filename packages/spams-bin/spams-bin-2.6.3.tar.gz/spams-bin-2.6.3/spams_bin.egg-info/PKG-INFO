Description: Python interface for SPArse Modeling Software (SPAMS),
        an optimization toolbox for solving various sparse estimation problems.
        This (unofficial) version includes pre-built wheels for python 3 on windows, mac (with openmp support) and linux.
        
        In addition, building from source explicitly requires openblas on mac/linux and intel mkl on windows,
        unlike the official version which can use any blas implementation.
