class InfidelityPwc(InfidelityNode):
    r"""
    Creates the total infidelity of the given piecewise-constant system.

    Use this function to compute the sum of the operational infidelity (which
    measures how effectively the system achieves a target gate) and filter
    function values (which measure how robust the system evolution is to
    various perturbative noise processes). This total infidelity value
    provides a cost that measures how effectively and robustly a set of
    controls achieves a target operation.

    Note that the total infidelity returned by this function is at least zero,
    but might be larger than one (for example if the system is highly
    sensitive to one of the noise processes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    hamiltonian : TensorPwc
        The control Hamiltonian :math:`H_{\mathrm c}(t)`. You can provide
        either a single Hamiltonian or a batch of them.
    target_operator : Target
        The object describing the target gate :math:`U_\mathrm{target}` and
        (optionally) the filter function projector :math:`P`. If you
        provide a batch of Hamiltonians, the function uses the same target
        for all the elements in the batch.
    noise_operators : List[TensorPwc], optional
        The perturbative noise operators :math:`\{N_j(t)\}`. You can omit this
        list if there are no noises. If you provide a batch of Hamiltonians
        rather than a single Hamiltonian, don't provide noise operators.
    name : str, optional
        The name of the node.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The total infidelity (operational infidelity plus filter function
        values) of the given system, with respect to the given target gate.
        If you provide a batch of Hamiltonians, the function returns a
        batch of infidelities contaning one infidelity for each Hamiltonian
        of the input batch.

    Warnings
    --------
    This function currently doesn't support noise operators when you
    provide a batch of Hamiltonians (rather than a single Hamiltonian).

    The Hessian matrix cannot currently be calculated for a graph which includes
    an `infidelity_pwc` node if the `hamiltonian` has degenerate eigenvalues at
    any segment.

    --------
    infidelity_stf : Corresponding function for sampleable controls.

    Notes
    -----
    The total system Hamiltonian is

    .. math:: H_{\mathrm c}(t) + \sum_j \beta_j(t) N_j(t),

    where :math:`\{\beta_j(t)\}` are small, dimensionless, stochastic
    variables.

    The total infidelity, as represented by this node, is the sum of the
    operational infidelity :math:`\mathcal{I}` and the filter functions
    :math:`\{F_j(0)\}` of each noise operator evaluated at zero frequency.

    The operational infidelity is

    .. math::
      \mathcal{I} = 1-\left|
        \frac{\mathrm{Tr} \left(U_\mathrm{target}^\dagger U(t)\right)}
        {\mathrm{Tr} \left(U_\mathrm{target}^\dagger U_\mathrm{target}\right)}
        \right|^2,

    where :math:`U(t)` is the unitary time evolution operator due to
    :math:`H_{\mathrm c}(t)`.

    The filter function for the noise operator :math:`N_j(t)` is a measure of
    robustness, defined at frequency :math:`f` as

    .. math::
      F_j(f) = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Tr}(P)} \mathrm{Tr} \left( P
        \mathcal{F} \left\{ \tilde N_j^\prime(t) \right\} \left[ \mathcal{F}
        \left\{ \tilde N^\prime (t) \right\} \right]^\dagger P \right),

    where :math:`\mathcal{F}` is the Fourier transform,
    :math:`\tilde N_j(t) \equiv U_c^\dagger(t) N_j(t) U_c(t)` is the
    toggling-frame noise operator, and
    :math:`\tilde N_j^\prime(t)\equiv
    \tilde N_j(t)-
    \frac{\mathrm{Tr}(P\tilde N_j(t)P)}{\mathrm{Tr}(P)} \mathbb{I}`
    differs from :math:`\tilde N_j(t)` only by a multiple of the identity but
    is trace-free on the subspace of interest. The filter function value at
    zero frequency quantifies the sensitivity of the controls to quasi-static
    noise applied via the corresponding noise operator.
