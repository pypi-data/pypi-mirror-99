	Docstring for function pyKrev.find_intersections
    
	====================
	This function compares n lists of molecular formula and outputs a dictionary containing the intersections between each list.
    
	Use
	----
	find_intersections([list_1,..,list_n],['group_1',...,'group_n'])
    
	Returns a dictionary in which each key corresponds to a combination of group labels 
	and the corresponding value is a set containing the intersections between the groups in that combination.  
    
	Parameters
	----------
	formula_lists: a list containing n lists of molecular formula. Each item in the sub list should be a formula string.
	group_labels: a list containing n strings of corresponding group labels.
	exclusive: True or False, depending on whether you want the intersections to contain only unique values.
