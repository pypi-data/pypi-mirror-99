    A backend mock has been added that enables better unit testing of the
    ironic-ui application by mocking the ironic API service. The mock utilizes
    angular $httpbackend handlers to intercept requests targeted at the
    ironic-ui server-side REST endpoints, and returns simulated responses.

    A number of unit tests have been developed that illustrate the use
    of the backend mock functionality.

    Although the backend mock is a work in progress, enough
    functionality already exists to support test development for
    the current set of in-progress features.
