    Support has been added for starting, stopping, and accessing the
    console associated with a node.
  - |
    The action dropdown menu in the node-details panel has a new item
    ``Enable|Disable console``.

    The node-details/overview panel has a new ``Console info`` item in the
    ``General`` section. The value of this field is dependent on the console
    type.

    For ``shellinabox``, the value is an anchor with the URL required
    to access the web console and title ``shellinabox``. For others, the
    value is a string representation of the ``console_info`` object returned
    by the ``get_console api`` call.
