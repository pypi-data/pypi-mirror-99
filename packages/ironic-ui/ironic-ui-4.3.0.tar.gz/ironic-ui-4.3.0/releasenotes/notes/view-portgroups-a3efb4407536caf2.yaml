    Adds support for viewing and managing the portgroups associated
    with an ironic node.

    A portgroup table has been added to the node-details/configuration tab.

    Each row in the table displays a single portgroup, and has column entries
    for its UUID, MAC address, name, and number of ports. A dropdown menu
    is also provided that contains actions that can be applied to the
    portgroup.

    Detailed information for a portgroup is obtained by clicking the
    detail-toggle-selector (right-chevron) located in its table row.
    The additional information is displayed in a row expansion.

    The port table in node-details/configuration tab has been modified
    as follows:

    * A column has been added that displays the UUID of the portgroup
      to which the port belongs.
    * The ``Properties`` column has been replaced with a column that
      displays only the boolean value of the ``pxe_enabled`` property.
    * Additional properties are displayed by clicking the
      detail-toggle-selector for that port in a similar manner to the
      portgroup table.
