# Lychrel

This is a collection of python functions which implements famous mathematical problems, 
and it is named after the [lychrel numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number).

Under the hood lychrel is implemented in rust thanks to [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

Any contribution is welcome!
