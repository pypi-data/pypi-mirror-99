def transform_homogeneous(matrices, vertices):
  """Applies 4x4 homogenous matrix transformations to xyz vertices.

  The vertices are input and output as as row-major, but are interpreted as
  column vectors multiplied on the right-hand side of the matrices. More
  explicitly, this function computes (MV^T)^T where M represents transformation
  matrices and V stands for vertices.
  Since input vertices are xyz they are extended to xyzw with w=1.

  Args:
    matrices: A tensor of shape `[batch, 4, 4]` containing batches of view
      projection matrices.
    vertices: A tensor of shape `[batch, num_vertices, 3]` containing batches of
      vertices, each defined by a 3D point.

  Returns:
    A [batch, N, 4] Tensor of xyzw vertices.
