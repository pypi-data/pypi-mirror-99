# Anime Character API

An unofficial API to get data about anime characters, anime news and more.
The API scrapes [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/) to get data about anime characters and anime news.

Currently, the API is very basic, but I will be adding a lot of stuff to easily extract data.

If you wish to see a feature, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/DriftAsimov/animec). We will surely work on it.
You can also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/x3qAZV3) to get regular updates about the API.

## Installation and Usage

To install the library:
```python
pip install animec
```

To import the library:
```python
import animec
# OR
from animec import *
```

## Examples

### Extracting an anime character's data

result = charsearch("okabe rintarou")

print(result.title, result.url, result.image_url, sep="\n")

### Requesting anime news

news = aninews(3)   #default value is 2
