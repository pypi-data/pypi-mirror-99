# Anime Character API

This is an unofficial API to extract an anime character data from [myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/).

Currently, the API is very basic, but I will be adding a lot of stuff to easily extract data.

If you wish to see a feature, please raise an issue. We will surely work on it.

## Installation and Usage

To install the library:
```python
pip install animec
```

To import the library:
```python
import animec
# OR
from animec import *
```

## Example 

### Obtaining the character's image url

```python
from animec import *

result = charsearch("okabe rintarou")

print(result.title, result.url, result.image_url, sep="\n")

'''
Output: (As retrived from myanimelist)
Rintarou Okabe (岡部 倫太郎)
