Upload videos to YouTube using geckodriver, Firefox profiles and Selenium. Easy to setup and use. Inspired by [youtube_uploader_selenium](https://github.com/linouk23/youtube_uploader_selenium).

"Opplast" is norwegian for "upload".

## Installing
Install and update using pip:

```
pip install --upgrade opplast
```

Download [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and place it inside `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37`. If you are using another version of Python, you place it inside there.  
**geckodriver needs to be added to PATH.** You can check this by opening your terminal and typing `geckodriver --version`.

## Configuration
Open Firefox, and go to `about:profiles`. Click "Create a New profile" and name it "Selenium" or whatever. Copy the "Root Directory" path of the new profile. This is your `root_profile_directory`. Now you can "Launch profile in new browser", go to [YouTube](https://youtube.com), and login to the account you want to upload with.

It's highly recommended that you clear your standard upload settings on YouTube.

```python
Upload(root_profile_directory: str, timeout: int = 3, headless: bool = True, debug: bool = True) -> None
```
`root_profile_directory: str` -  path to Firefox profile where you're logged into YouTube.

`timeout: int` - seconds Selenium should wait, when getting pages and inserting data. Default: `3`.

`headless: bool` - whether or not you want to see the browser GUI. Default: `True` (hidden).

`debug: bool` - whether or not you want to see the debug info. Default: `True` (shown).


## Usage
```python
from opplast import Upload


upload = Upload(
    "C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/random.selenium",
)

was_uploaded, video_id = upload.upload(
    {
        "file": "path/to/video.mp4",
        "title": "My YouTube Title",
        "description": "My YouTube Description",
        "thumbnail": "path/to/thumbnail.jpg",
        "tags": ["these", "are", "my", "tags"]
    }
)

if was_uploaded:
    print(f"{video_id} has been uploaded to YouTube")

upload.close()
```
