    A test library providing device pool support for testing.

        ``KiticaLibrary`` is a Robot Framework third party library that \
        enables test to borrow available user from a device pool. These \
        allows test to run in CI server without device conflict and \
        lessen setup and maintenance on a project.

        - borrowing an available device from the devicepool and returning it.
        - retrieving a device from the devicepool by `deviceId`

        ``KiticaLibrary`` is part of the ``kitica`` project and is built to
        provide support devicepool setup for running tests in RobotFramework
        setup.

        ``kitica`` is a devicepool project written in Python that provides
        RESTful API service, Host Client Listener for both iOS and Android
        and aims to support local device farm setups.

    | Library    | KiticaLibrary   | base_url                           |

    You can import this library in your robot test suite by using the   \
        syntax below.
    For the parameters on import. Read `Importing`.

    *Example:*
    | =Settings= | =Value=         | =Parameter=                        |
    | Library    | UserpoolLibrary | http://kitica.dev                  |

    `Borrow Device`, `Borrow Android Device` and `Borrow iOS Device`    \
    returns a json object containing the following information:

    *JSON Representation:*
    | {
    |     "deviceId": 1,
    |     "deviceName": "Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra",
    |     "platformName": "Android",
    |     "server": "192.168.xxx.xxx:4723/wd/hub",

    |     "driverPath": "/path/to/webdriver"
    | }
    See `Borrowed Device Object Values` for the values decription.

    = Borrowed Device Object Values =

    == deviceId ==
    The unique integer value that is tagged to a specific device, could be used
    as parameter in `Borrow Device` Keyword to target a specific device.

    Could be used together with the `forced` argument to force the service to
    provide the device even when the device's ``status`` is ``ACTIVE``
    but not ``UNPLUGGED``.

    == deviceName ==
    The name of the device borrowed. When Running Appium XCUITEST in real iOS
    devices, this value is required.

    == platformName ==
    Denotes the platform of the device, should only be either ``Android``
    or ``iOS``.

    == server ==
    The device farm host the returned device is connected to.

    == systemPort ==
    systemPort used to connect to appium-uiautomator2-server or
    appium-espresso-driver. The default is 8200 in general and selects one
    port from 8200 to 8299 for appium-uiautomator2-server, it is 8300 from
    8300 to 8399 for appium-espresso-driver. When you run tests in parallel,
    you must adjust the port to avoid conflicts. Read Parallel Testing Setup
    Guide for more details.

    == mjpegServerPort ==
    Must be in range 1024..65535. 7810 by default

    == udid ==
    The device's unique Identification, at least for real devices, for AVD
    emulated devices uses the pattern ``emulator-xxxx`` as its `udid` value.

    == platformVersion ==
    The version of the platform of the borrowed device.

    == status ==
    Denotes the status of the device returned by the kitica API service.

    == teamName ==
    The team owner of the device, will be bypassed when `Borrow Device` is
    provided by ``forced==true`` and ``deviceId`` parameter.

    == version ==
    iterates whenever the device field is updated.

    == borrowerIp ==
    Stores the value of the latest borrower of the device.

    == borrowerHostname ==
    Stores the hostname of the latest borrower of the device.

    == lastBorrowed ==
    Logs the date and time the device was last borrowed.

    == deviceType ==
    Indicates whether the returned device is either a `Real Device` or an
    `Emulator`.

    == driverpath ==
    The resolvable PATH of the device host server the device is connected to.

        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformName=Android          |
        Both example will produce the same result since ``platformName``
        will default to ``Android`` when no value is provided.

        === Borrowing an iOS Device ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformName=iOS              |
        Note that ``iOS`` parameter is case sensitive.

        === Borrowing Device with specific platformVersion ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformName=Android  \
                                            | platformVersion=9     |
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | platformVersion=iOS   \
                                            | platformVersion=13.3  |
        When ``platformVersion`` is omitted as an argument, the service will
        try to search for the specific version, but, if no device with such
        version is found, kitica API will return None.

        === Borrowing a Device using deviceId ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | deviceId=1            |
        The service will return the specific device if and only if the
        specified device's status is ``FREE``. Will raise a
        ``DeviceBorrowError`` if the device specified is ``ACTIVE`` or
        ``UNPLUGGED``.

        === NOTE ===
         - When ``deviceId`` is provided all other arguments provided is\
         ignored except for ``forced``.

        === Borrowing a device using deviceID with forced set to True ===
        | ${device}     | `Borrow Device`   | deviceID=1            \
                                            | forced=True           |
        When borrowing a device with forced set to ``True``, the service will
        return the specified device even when it's current status is
        ``ACTIVE``, but not when it is ``UNPLUGGED``.

        ``forced`` is only implemented when ``deviceId`` is specified and will
        be ignored when ``deviceId`` is not provided.
