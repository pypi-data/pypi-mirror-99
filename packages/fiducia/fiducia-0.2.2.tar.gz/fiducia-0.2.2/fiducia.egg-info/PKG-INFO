        FIDUCIA (C20073): Filtered Diode Unfolder (using) Cubic-spline Algorithm
        
        This is a DANTE signal deconvolver based on the [cubic splines method](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0002856). 
        Given time-resolved DANTE data, this code can produce time-resolve x-ray 
        spectra, and radiation temperatures. Functionality is described in [Fiducia's online documentation](https://fiducia.readthedocs.io/).
