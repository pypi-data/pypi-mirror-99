Description: # SparkConnector
        
        Helper to connect to CERN's Spark Clusters
        
        This extension is composed of a Python package named `sparkconnector`, which installs the nbextension and a NPM package named `@swan-cern/sparkconnector`
        for the JupyterLab extension.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * JupyterLab >= 2.0
        
        ## Install
        
        Note: You will need NodeJS to install the extension.
        
        ```bash
        pip install sparkconnector
        jupyter nbextension install sparkconnector --py
        jupyter nbextension enable  sparkconnector --py
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        ## Troubleshoot
        
        If you are not seeing the frontend, check if it's installed:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension list
        ```
        
        If it is installed, try:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter lab clean
        jupyter lab build
        ```

        ### Install
        
        The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
        [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
        `yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.
        
        ```bash
        # Clone the repo to your local environment
        # Move to sparkconnector directory
        
        # Install server extension
        # This will also build the js code
        pip install -e .
        
        # Install and enable the nbextension
        jupyter nbextension install sparkconnector --py --sys-prefix
        jupyter nbextension enable  sparkconnector --py --sys-prefix
        
        # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
        jupyter labextension link .
        # Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
        jupyter lab build
        
        # Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
        jlpm build
        # Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.
        
        ```bash
        # Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
        jlpm watch
        # Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
        jupyter lab --watch
        ```
        
        ### Uninstall
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall sparkconnector
        jupyter labextension uninstall @swan-cern/sparkconnector
        ```
