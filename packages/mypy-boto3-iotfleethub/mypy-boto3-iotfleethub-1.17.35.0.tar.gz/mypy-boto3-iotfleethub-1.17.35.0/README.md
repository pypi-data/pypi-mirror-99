## How to install

Install `boto3-stubs` for `IoTFleetHub` service.

```bash
python -m pip install boto3-stubs[iotfleethub]
```

## Usage

### VSCode

- Install [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- Install [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- Set `Pylance` as your Python Language Server
- Install `boto-stubs[iotfleethub]` in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[iotfleethub]'`

Both type checking and auto-complete should work for `IoTFleetHub` service.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

### PyCharm

- Install `boto-stubs[iotfleethub]` in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[iotfleethub]'`

Both type checking and auto-complete should work for `IoTFleetHub` service.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.
Auto-complete can be slow on big projects or if you have a lot of installed `boto3-stubs` submodules.

### Other IDEs

Not tested, but as long as your IDE support `mypy` or `pyright`, everything should work.

### mypy

- Install `mypy`: `python -m pip install mypy`
- Install `boto-stubs[iotfleethub]` in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[iotfleethub]'`
- Run `mypy` as usual

Type checking should work for `IoTFleetHub` service.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

### pyright

- Install `pyright`: `yarn global add pyright`
- Install `boto-stubs[iotfleethub]` in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[iotfleethub]'`
- Optionally, you can install `boto3-stubs` to `typings` folder.

Type checking should work for `IoTFleetHub` service.
No explicit type annotations required, write your `boto3` code as usual.

## Explicit type annotations

### Client annotations

`IoTFleetHubClient` provides annotations for `boto3.client("iotfleethub")`.

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3_iotfleethub import IoTFleetHubClient

client: IoTFleetHubClient = boto3.client("iotfleethub")

# now client usage is checked by mypy and IDE should provide code auto-complete

# works for session as well
session = boto3.session.Session(region="us-west-1")
session_client: IoTFleetHubClient = session.client("iotfleethub")
```

### Paginators annotations

`mypy_boto3_iotfleethub.paginator` module contains type annotations for all paginators.

```python
from mypy_boto3_iotfleethub import IoTFleetHubClient
from mypy_boto3_iotfleethub.paginator import (
    ListApplicationsPaginator,
)

client: IoTFleetHubClient = boto3.client("iotfleethub")

# Explicit type annotations are optional here
# Type should be correctly discovered by mypy and IDEs
# VSCode requires explicit type annotations
list_applications_paginator: ListApplicationsPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_applications")
```







### Typed dictionations

`mypy_boto3_iotfleethub.type_defs` module contains structures and shapes assembled
to typed dictionaries for additional type checking.

```python
from mypy_boto3_iotfleethub.type_defs import (
    ApplicationSummaryTypeDef,
    CreateApplicationResponseTypeDef,
    DescribeApplicationResponseTypeDef,
    ListApplicationsResponseTypeDef,
    ListTagsForResourceResponseTypeDef,
    PaginatorConfigTypeDef,
)

def get_structure() -> ApplicationSummaryTypeDef:
    return {
      ...
    }
```
