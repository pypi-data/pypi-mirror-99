# NeqSim Python
NeqSim Python is part of the [NeqSim project](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/). NeqSim Python is a Python interface to the [NeqSim Java library](https://github.com/equinor/neqsim) for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production. NeqSim Python toolboxes (eg. [thermoTools](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython/blob/master/src/neqsim/thermo/thermoTools.py) and [processTools](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython/blob/master/src/neqsim/process/processTools.py)) are implemented to streamline use of neqsim in Python. Examples of use are given in jupyter workbooks.

## Releases
The NeqSim Python package is distributed as a pip package. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython/wiki) for instructions on how to use it. Install the package by running
>pip install neqsim

## Getting Started
See the [NeqSim Python Wiki](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython/wiki) for how to use NeqSim Python via Python or in Jupyter notebooks. Also see [examples of use of NeqSim for Gas Processing in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EvenSol/NeqSim-Colab/blob/master/notebooks/examples_of_NeqSim_in_Colab.ipynb#scrollTo=kHt6u-utpvYf).

### Prerequisites
A Java run time environment ([Java JRE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html)) needs to be installed. The Python package [JPype](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype) is used to connect Python and Java. The needed Python packages are listed in the [NeqSim Python dependencies page](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython/network/dependencies).

### Initial setup
The NeqSim Python package is installed by downloading/cloning the library to your local computer (alternatively fork it to your private reprository). The following commands are dependent on a local installation of [GIT](https://git-scm.com/). |pypidownloads| |pypiversion| 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython.git
cd neqsimpython
pip install .
