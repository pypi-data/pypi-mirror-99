        ## Big Data Bag Utilities
        
        The `bdbag` utilities are a collection of software programs for working with
        [BagIt](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-bagit/) packages that conform to the BDBag and Bagit/RO profiles.
        
        The `bdbag` [profiles](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag/tree/master/profiles) specify the use of the `fetch.txt` 
        file, require serialization, and specify what manifests must be provided with a `bdbag`.
        
        The `bdbag` utilities incorporate functions from various other Python-based `bagit` components (such as the
        [Bagit-Python](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python) bag creation utility and the
        [Bagit-Profiles-Validator](https://github.com/ruebot/bagit-profiles)
        utility) and wraps them in a single, easy to use software package with additional features.
        
        Enhanced bag support includes:
        
        * Update-in-place functionality for existing bags.
        * Automatic archiving and extraction of bags using ZIP, TAR, and TGZ formats.
        * Automatic generation of file manifest entries and `fetch.txt` for remote files via configuration file.
        * Automatic file retrieval based on the contents of a bag's `fetch.txt` file with multiple protocol support. Transport 
          handlers for `http(s)`,`ftp`,`s3`,`gs`, and `globus` are provided, along with an extensibility mechanism for adding 
          externally developed transports.  
        * Built-in `bagit-profile` validation.
        * Built-in support for creation of bags with [Bagit/RO profile](https://github.com/ResearchObject/bagit-ro) compatibility.
        
        An experimental Graphical User Interface (GUI) for `bdbag` can be found [here](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag_gui).
        
        #### Technical Papers
        
        ["I'll take that to go: Big data bags and minimal identifiers for exchange of large, complex datasets"](https://zenodo.org/record/820878) explains the motivation for BDBags and the related Minid construct, provides details on design and implementation, and gives examples of use. 
        
        ["Reproducible big data science: A case study in continuous FAIRness"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/268755) presents a data analysis use case in which BDBags and Minids are used to capture a transcription factor binding site analysis.
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-27/) is the minimum Python version required.
        * The code and dependencies are also compatible with Python 3, versions 3.5 through 3.9.
        
        ### Installation
        The latest `bdbag` release is available on PyPi and can be installed using `pip`:
        
        ```sh
        pip install bdbag
        ```
        
        Note that the above command will install `bdbag` with only the minimal dependencies required to run.
        If you wish to install `bdbag` with the extra fetch transport handler support provided by `boto` (for AWS S3)
        and `globus` (for Globus Transfer) packages, use the following command:
        ```sh
        pip install bdbag[boto,globus]
        ```
        
        ### Installation from Source
        You can use `pip` to install `bdbag` directly from GitHub:
        
        ```sh
        sudo pip install git+https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag
        ```
        or:
        ```sh
        pip install --user git+https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag
        ```
        
        You can also [download](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag/archive/master.zip) the current `bdbag` source code from GitHub or
        alternatively clone the source from GitHub if you have *git* installed:
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag
        ```
        From the root of the `bdbag` source code directory execute the following command:
        ```sh
        sudo pip install .
        ```
        or:
        ```sh
        pip install --user .
        ```
        Note that if you want to install the extra dependencies from a local source directory you would use the following command:
        ```sh
        pip install .[boto,globus]
        ```
        
        ### Testing
        The unit tests can be run by invoking the following command from the root of the `bdbag` source code directory:
        ```sh
        python setup.py test
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        This software can be used from the command-line environment by running the `bdbag` script.  For detailed usage
        instructions, see the [CLI Guide](./doc/cli.md).
        
        ### Configuration
        
        Some components of the `bdbag` software can be configured via JSON-formatted configuration files.
        See the [Configuration Guide](./doc/config.md) for further details.
        
        ### Application Programming Interface
        
        It is also possible to use `bdbag` from within other Python programs via an API.
        See the [API Guide](./doc/api.md) for further details.
        
        ### Utilities
        
        A CLI utility module is provided for various ancillary tasks commonly involved with authoring **bdbags**.
        See the [Utility Guide](./doc/utils.md) for further details.
