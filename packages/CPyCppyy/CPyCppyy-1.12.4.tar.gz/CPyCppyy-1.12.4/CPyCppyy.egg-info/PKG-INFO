        CPyCppyy: Python-C++ bindings interface based on Cling/LLVM
        ===========================================================
        
        CPyCppyy is the CPython equivalent of _cppyy in PyPy.
        It provides dynamic Python-C++ bindings by leveraging the Cling C++
        interpreter and LLVM.
        Details and performance are described in
        `this paper <http://conferences.computer.org/pyhpc/2016/papers/5220a027.pdf>`_.
        
        CPyCppyy is a CPython extension module built on top of the same backend API
        as PyPy/_cppyy.
        It thus requires the installation of the
        `cppyy backend <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cppyy-backend/>`_
        for use, which will pull in Cling.
        CPython/cppyy and PyPy/cppyy are designed to be compatible, although there
        are differences due to the former being reference counted and the latter
        being garbage collected, as well as temporary differences due to different
        release cycles of the respective projects.
