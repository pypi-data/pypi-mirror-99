Description: # discord_slash.py

        # Why is it forced to a guild?
        Because I hate having the 1 hour cache when testing the output of these shits, so while I test, it will be controlled by config.json on which guild_id it will make commands to. I will later in time make a more dynamic way to change between global and guild.
        
        # Commands folder
        - Class name = Command name
        - Class doc = Command desc.
        - async reply = The JSON sent back as reply to Discord's POST webhook
