    :param channel_id:  Channel Identification
     The channel that receives the reading is determined by the following
     rules:
     Direct pointers to a channel
     If the channelId is supplied, then import to that channel.
     If the channelId is not supplied look at the channelImportId property,
     which indicates a specific channel.
     Inferred pointers to a channel
     If the channelId and channelImportId are not supplied, look at the
     meterImportId property, which indicates a meter.If that meter has one
     channel, import to that channel.
     If that meter has more than one channel, find the channel with the same
     observation type as the observationTypeCode property.If only one is found,
     import to that channel.
     If more than one channel is found based on observation type, find the
     channel with the same output unit as the unitCode property.If only one is
     found, import to that channel.
     If more than one channel is found based on unit, find the channel with the
     same channelIntervalInSeconds property. If only one is found, import to
     that channel. <span class='property-internal'>Topmost (Channel)</span>
