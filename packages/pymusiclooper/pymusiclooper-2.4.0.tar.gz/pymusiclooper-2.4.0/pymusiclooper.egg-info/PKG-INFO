Description: # PyMusicLooper
        
        A python script for repeating music seamlessly and endlessly, by automatically finding the best loop points.
        
        Features:
        
        - Find loop points within any music file (if they exist).
        - Supports a large set of different audio formats, and all the popular ones (MP3, OGG, M4A, FLAC, WAV, etc).
        - Play the music file endlessly and seamlessly with the best discovered loop.
        - Export to intro/loop/outro sections for editing or seamless playback within any music player that supports [gapless playback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapless_playback).
        - Export loop points in samples to a text file (e.g. for use in creating custom themes with seamlessly looping audio).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Pre-requisites
        
        The following software must be installed for `pymusiclooper` to function correctly.
        
        - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.6
        - [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (adds support for MP3 and other audio formats)
        - [mpg123](https://www.mpg123.de/download.shtml) to play/preview music loops through the terminal
        
        ### Installing using pip
        
        ```sh
        pip install pymusiclooper
        ```
        
        ### Installing directly from git
        
        ```sh
        pip install git+https://github.com/arkrow/PyMusicLooper.git
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```raw
        usage: pymusiclooper [-h] [-v] [-i] [-p] [-e] [--preserve-tags] [-t] [-r] [-f] [-n N_JOBS] [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
                             [-m MIN_DURATION_MULTIPLIER] [-V]
                             path
        
        A script for repeating music seamlessly and endlessly, by automatically finding the best loop points.
        
        positional arguments:
          path                  path to file or directory
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -v, --verbose         enable verbose logging output
          -i, --interactive     manually preview/choose which loop to use out of the discovered loop points
          -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
        
        Play:
          -p, --play            play the song on repeat with the best discovered loop point (default).
        
        Export:
          -e, --export          export the song into intro, loop and outro files (WAV format).
          --preserve-tags       export with the track's original tags. [currently disabled]
          -t, --txt             export the loop points of a track in samples and append to a loop.txt file (compatible with
                                LoopingAudioConverter).
          -r, --recursive       process directories and their contents recursively (has an effect only if the given path is a directory).
          -f, --flatten         flatten the output directory structure instead of preserving it when using the --recursive flag.
          -n N_JOBS, --n-jobs N_JOBS
                                number of files to batch process at a time (default: 1). WARNING: greater values result in higher memory
                                consumption.
        
        General Options:
          -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                                specify a different output directory.
          -m MIN_DURATION_MULTIPLIER, --min-duration-multiplier MIN_DURATION_MULTIPLIER
                                specify minimum loop duration as a multiplier of song duration (default: 0.35)
        ```
        
        PyMusicLooper will find the best loop point it can detect, and will then, depending on your arguments:
        
        (a) play the song on repeat using the best discovered loop point (default, requires [mpg123](https://www.mpg123.de/download.shtml));
        
        (b) export intro/loop/outro sections of the song (currently outputs as WAV-only; however you may convert them with [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) or [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/));
        
        (c) export the loop points (in samples) to a text file compatible with [LoopingAudioConverter](https://github.com/libertyernie/LoopingAudioConverter/), which you can use for audio loops in custom theme creation, game engine audio loops, etc.
        
        **Note**: using the interactive `-i` option is highly recommended, since the algorithmically chosen "best" loop point may not be perceptually good, mainly due to some chosen loop points causing 'sound popping' when played.
        
        ## Example Usage
        
        Side note: Most terminals support file drag-and-drop, which can be utilized instead of manual path navigation/selection.
        
        ### Play
        
        Play the song on repeat with the best discovered loop point.
        
        ```sh
        pymusiclooper "TRACK_NAME.mp3"
        ```
        
        ### Export
        
        Export the song into intro, loop and outro files.
        
        ```sh
        pymusiclooper -e "TRACK_NAME.ogg"
        ```
        
        Export the loop points of all the songs in a particular directory to a single loop.txt file (compatible with [LoopingAudioConverter](https://github.com/libertyernie/LoopingAudioConverter/)).
        
        ```sh
        pymusiclooper -t "/path/to/dir/"
        ```
        
        Note: each line in loop.txt follows the following format: `{loop-start} {loop-end} {filename}`
        
        ### Miscellaneous
        
        If the loop is very long (or very short), you may specify a different minimum duration for the algorithm to use, which is 0.35 (35%) by default.
        If the most of the track is the loop section, specifying a higher multiplier will also speed the algorithm up.
        Here `-m 0.85` means that, excluding silence, the loop section is at least 85% of the music track.
        
        ```sh
        pymusiclooper "TRACK_NAME.flac" -m 0.85
        ```
        
        Loop points can be chosen and previewed interactively before playback/export using the `-i` flag, e.g.
        
        ```sh
        pymusiclooper "TRACK_NAME.wav" -e -i
        ```
        
        ### Example of multiple functionalities in action
        
        Export intro/loop/outro sections and loop points of all the songs in the current directory and its subdirectories, to a folder called "Music Loops", processing 4 tracks concurrently, preserving the original tags.
        
        ```sh
        pymusiclooper -ret . -o "Music Loops" -n 4 --preserve-tags
        ```
        
        ## Building from source
        
        Required python packages: `pip` and `setuptools`.
        
        Clone the git repository to a directory of your choice and cd to inside the repo.
        
        Run:
        
        ```sh
        python setup.py build
        ```
        
        Followed by:
        
        ```sh
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Acknowledgement
        
        This project started out as a fork of [Nolan Nicholson](https://github.com/NolanNicholson)'s project [Looper](https://github.com/NolanNicholson/Looper/). Although at this point only a few lines of code remain from that project due to adopting a completely different approach and implementation; this project would not have been possible without their initial contribution.
