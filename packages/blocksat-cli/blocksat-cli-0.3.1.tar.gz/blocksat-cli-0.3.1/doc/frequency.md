This page summarizes several frequencies of interest. We will refer to them
later in the user guide.

## Signal Bands

Blockstream Satellite operates in Ku high band, Ku low band and C band,
depending on region. Ku high band is used in North America and South America. Ku
low band is used in Africa, Europe, and Asia. C band is used in the Asia-Pacific
region.

| Band         | Frequency Range   |
|--------------|-------------------|
| C band       | 3.7 GHZ - 4.2 GHz |
| Ku low band  | 10.7 to 11.7 GHz  |
| Ku high band | 11.7 to 12.75 GHz |

## Signal Frequencies

The following table summarizes the transmission bands and frequencies of the
signals that we broadcast in each coverage region:

| Satellite          | Band    | Frequency    |
|--------------------|---------|--------------|
| Galaxy 18          | Ku High | 12016.4 MHz  |
| Eutelsat 113       | Ku High | 12066.9 MHz  |
| Telstar 11N Africa | Ku Low  | 11480.7 MHz  |
| Telstar 11N Europe | Ku Low  | 11484.3 MHz  |
| Telstar 18V Ku     | Ku Low  | 11506.75 MHz |
| Telstar 18V C      | C       | 4053.83 MHz  |

## L-band Frequencies

Next, the following table summarizes the L-band frequencies to be used in each
region based on the typical LNB local oscillator (LO) frequencies:

| LO Frequency        | 5150 MHz    | 9750 MHz    | 10600 MHz    | 10750 MHz    |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Galaxy 18           |             |             | 1416.40 MHz  | 1266.40 MHz  |
| Eutelsat 113        |             |             | 1466.90 MHz  | 1316.90 MHz  |
| Telstar 11N Africa  |             | 1730.70 MHz |              |              |
| Telstar 11N Europe  |             | 1734.30 MHz |              |              |
| Telstar 18V Ku Band |             | 1756.75 MHz |              |              |
| Telstar 18V C Band  | 1096.17 MHz |             |              |              |
