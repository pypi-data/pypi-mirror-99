Description: PYTHON DEEPOPS MODULE
        =====================
        
        This module contains some functions for performing "deep" operations on
        standard Python "compound" data structures - lists/sets/dictionaries:
        
        * `deepmerge()` - merges two compound structures, including all
          sub-items, e.g. items to lists and sets, missing keys/items to
          dictionaries, optionally replacing clashing simple types.
        * `deepremoveitems()` - removes items (simple types, or whole compound
          structures) from within another compound data structure.
        * `deepdiff()` - compares two compound structures and returns a tuple
          of items to be removed and items to be updated: these could be passed
          to `deepremoveitems()` and `deepmerge()`, respectively, to transform
          one into the other (although note that they would need to be
          `deepcopy()`ed first).
        
        The module was developed and used under Python 3.4-3.7 but seems to
        work OK in basic testing under 2.7.
