A library for adding new science data products to an observatory control system's science archive. The library
handles uploading FITS files into AWS S3, as well as adding records to the science archive's database containing
the searchable metadata of all available FITS files.

## Prerequisites

Optional prerequisites may be skipped for reduced functionality.

-   Python >= 3.6
-   A running [science archive](https://github.com/observatorycontrolsystem/science-archive)
-   Write access to the same S3 bucket that the running science archive is using
-   (Optional) A running [OpenTSDB](http://opentsdb.net/) for metrics collection

## Installation

It is highly recommended that you install and run your python code inside a dedicated python
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

Add the `ocs_ingester` package to your python environment:

```bash
(venv) $ pip install ocs_ingester
```

## Configuration

AWS and science archive credentials must be set in order to upload data. Science archive configuration as well as the
AWS Bucket can be either passed explicitly or set as environment variables. The rest of the configuration must be
set as environment variables.
