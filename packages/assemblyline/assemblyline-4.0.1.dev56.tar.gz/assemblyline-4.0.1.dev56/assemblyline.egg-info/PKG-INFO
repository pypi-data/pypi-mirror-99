Description: # Assemblyline 4 - Automated malware analysis framework
        
        AssemblyLine 4 is an open source malware analysis framework. It leverages Kubernetes and Docker to adapt to many use cases; from a small appliance for supporting manual malware analysis and security teams to large-scale enterprise security operations scanning millions of files a day and providing triage capabilities.
        
        AssemblyLine can be easily integrated in your environment using itâ€™s powerful rest API and web interfaces. The platform comes with dozens of services to provide deep file analysis and enable integration with other security platforms such as anti-virus, malware-detonation sandboxes and threat knowledge bases. Best of all, with a little bit of Python code you can extend it yourself by creating new analysis and integration services.
        
        ### Repository information 
        
        This is Assemblyline 4 base repository. It provides Assemblyline with common libraries, cachestore, datastore, filestore, ODM and remote datatypes.
        
        #### System requirements
        
        Assemblyline 4 will only work on systems running python3.7+ and was only tested on linux systems.   
        
        #### Installation requirements
        
        If used outside of our normal container this library requires outside linux libraries.
         * libffi6 (dev)
         * libfuxxy2 (dev)
         * libmagic1
         * python3.7 (dev)
         
        Here is an example on how you would get those libraries on a `Ubuntu 18.04+` system:
        
            sudo apt install libffi6 libfuzzy2 libmagic1 build-essential libffi-dev python3.7 python3-dev python3-pip libfuzzy-dev
