Description: # django-sql-dashboard
        
        Django app for building dashboards using raw SQL queries
        
        Brings a useful subset of [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) to Django.
        
        Currently only works with PostgreSQL.
        
        This is **very early alpha**. You should not yet trust this code, especially with regards to security. Do not run this in production (yet)!
