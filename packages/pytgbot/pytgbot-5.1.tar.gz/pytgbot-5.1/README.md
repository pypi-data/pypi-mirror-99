# Usage

```python
from pytgbot import Bot

API_KEY='123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11'  # change this to the token you get from @BotFather
CHAT='@username'  # can be a @username or a id, change this to your own @username or id for example.

bot = Bot(API_KEY)

# sending messages:
bot.send_message(CHAT, "Example Text!")

# getting events:
for x in bot.get_updates():
	print(x)

```

All the functions can be found in the `Bot` class in the [pytgbot/bot.py](https://github.com/luckydonald/pytgbot/blob/master/pytgbot/bot.py) file.
They are pythonic in small letters with underscores instead of camel case, for example [getUpdates](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates) is `bot.get_updates()`.
## Documentation
You can always inspect the documentation inside the code.
You can also use the python `help()` command in the interactive interpreter:
```py
>>> from pytgbot import Bot
>>> help(Bot)
>>> # or
>>> help(Bot.get_updates)
```

## Custom servers
If you want to use a custom Telegram API server, e.g. https://telegram.rest/ it is as simple as setting `base_url` and `download_url` when creating the bot:
```py
bot = Bot(API_KEY, base_url="https://telegram.rest/bot{api_key}/{command}", download_url="https://telegram.rest/file/bot{api_key}/{file}")
```

## Examples
Have a look into the [examples](https://github.com/luckydonald/pytgbot/tree/master/examples) folder.

# In case of errors
First you should set logging to level `DEBUG` to see what's going on.
```py
# add this to the first lines in your file
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

If you are about to open a new issue, search the existing ones (open and closed) first.
Sometimes they are already reported or even solved.

# Note for maintainers of this package:
Best way to apply changes is to create a patch from the commit containing the new generated files `output`.

```
git apply --verbose --reject --no-index -C1 --whitespace=fix --ignore-space-change --ignore-whitespace --directory pytgbot/ NAME.patch
find ./pytgbot/ -type f -name '*.rej' | xargs --replace={}  --max-args=1   echo "{} {}"
find ./pytgbot/ -type f -name '*.rej' |  xargs  --replace={}  --max-args=1  bash -c 'file="{}";file="${file%.*}"; echo wiggle --replace ${file} {};'
wiggle --replace pytgbot
```
You may need to install wiggle: `brew install wiggle`
