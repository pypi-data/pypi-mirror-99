This Python package provide a series of tools to integrate and query the genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and
clinical data (aka multi-omics data). With scalable data-frame manipulation tools, OpenOmics facilitates the common
data wrangling tasks when preparing data for RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis.

## Features
OpenOmics assist in integration of heterogeneous multi-omics bioinformatics data. The library provides a Python API as well as an interactive Dash web interface.
It features support for:
- Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, and Clinical data.
- Harmonization with 20+ popular annotation, interaction, disease-association databases.

OpenOmics also has an efficient data pipeline that bridges the popular data manipulation Pandas library and Dask distributed processing to address the following use cases:

- Providing a standard pipeline for dataset indexing, table joining and querying, which are transparent and customizable
  for end-users.
- Providing Efficient disk storage for large multi-omics dataset with Parquet data structures.
- Integrating various data types including interactions and sequence data, then exporting to NetworkX graphs or data generators for down-stream machine learning.
- Accessible by both developers and scientists with a Python API that works seamlessly with an external Galaxy tool interface or the built-in Dash web interface (WIP).


## Installation via pip:

```
$ pip install openomics
```
