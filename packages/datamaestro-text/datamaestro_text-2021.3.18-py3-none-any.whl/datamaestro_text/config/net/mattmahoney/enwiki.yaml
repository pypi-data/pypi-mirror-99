#   The test data for the Large Text Compression Benchmark is the first 109 bytes
#   of the English Wikipedia dump on Mar. 3, 2006.
#   http://download.wikipedia.org/enwiki/20060303/enwiki-20060303-pages-articles.xml.bz2
#   (1.1 GB or 4.8 GB after decompressing with bzip2 - link no longer works).
#   Results are also given for the first 108 bytes, which is also used for the
#   Hutter Prize.

#   The data is UTF-8 encoded XML consisting primarily of English text. enwik9
#   contains 243,426 article titles, of which 85,560 are links, and the rest are
#   regular articles. The example fragment below shows a redirection of "AdA" to
#   "Ada programming language" and the start of a regular article with title
#   "Anarchism".

#   The data is UTF-8 clean. All characters are in the range U'0000 to U'10FFFF
#   with valid encodings of 1 to 4 bytes. The byte values 0xC0, 0xC1, and
#   0xF5-0xFF never occur. Also, in the Wikipedia dumps, there are no control
#   characters in the range 0x00-0x1F except for 0x09 (tab) and 0x0A (linefeed).
#   Linebreaks occur only on paragraph boundaries, so they always have a semantic
#   purpose. In the example below, lines were broken at 80 characters, but in
#   reality each paragraph is one long line.

#   The data contains some URL encoded XHTML tags such as &lt;ref&gt ...
#   &lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;br /&gt; which decode to <ref> ... </ref> (citation) and
#   <br /> (line break). However, hypertext links have their own encoding.
#   External links are enclosed in square brackets in the form [URL anchor text].
#   Internal links are encoded as [[Wikipedia title | anchor text]], omitting the
#   title and vertical bar if the title and anchor text are identical. Non-English
#   characters are sometimes URL encoded as &amp;#945;, meaning &#945; (Greek
#   alpha, Î±), but are more often coded directly as a UTF-8 byte sequence.
