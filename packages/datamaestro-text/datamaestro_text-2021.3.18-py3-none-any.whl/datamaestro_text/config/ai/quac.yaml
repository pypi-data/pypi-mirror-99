#   Question Answering in Context is a dataset for modeling, understanding, and
#   participating in information seeking dialog. Data instances consist of an
#   interactive dialog between two crowd workers: (1) a student who poses a
#   sequence of freeform questions to learn as much as possible about a hidden
#   Wikipedia text, and (2) a teacher who answers the questions by providing short
#   excerpts (spans) from the text. QuAC introduces challenges not found in
#   existing machine comprehension datasets: its questions are often more
#   open-ended, unanswerable, or only meaningful within the dialog context.
