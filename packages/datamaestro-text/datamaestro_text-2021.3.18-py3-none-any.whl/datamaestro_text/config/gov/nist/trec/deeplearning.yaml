# description: |
#   The Deep Learning Track studies information retrieval in a large training data
#   regime. This is the case where the number of training queries with at least one
#   positive label is at least in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of
#   thousands or more. This corresponds to real-world scenarios such as training

#   pooling in the TREC Million Query Track or the evaluation of search engines
#   based on early precision).
