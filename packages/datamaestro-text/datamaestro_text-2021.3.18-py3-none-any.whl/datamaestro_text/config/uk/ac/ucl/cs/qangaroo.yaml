description: |
      We have created two new Reading Comprehension datasets focussing on
      multi-hop (alias multi-step) inference.

      Several pieces of information often jointly imply another fact. In multi-hop
      inference, a new fact is derived by combining facts via a chain of multiple
      steps.

      Our aim is to build Reading Comprehension methods that perform multi-hop
      inference on text, where individual facts are spread out across different
      documents.

      The two QAngaroo datasets provide a training and evaluation resource for such
      methods.
