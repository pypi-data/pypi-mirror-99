Description: # pyvmrun
        ##Introduction
        
        This is a python wrapper for vmrun, used to control VMWare virtual machines. It 
        is based off of vmrun-python by @Binjo, whose idea is in-turn based on Alexander
        Sotirov's vmrun-ruby. Assumed, same as original, to support only VMWare Fusion/WS
        versions 6.0 and above.
        
        ## Basic Usage
        ```python
        import pyvmrun
        vm = pyvmrun.Vmrun( 'full/path/to/your/foo.vmx' )
        vm.start()
        vm.suspend()
        vm.stop()
        ```
        
        ## Known Issues
        
        1. Calls to revertToSnapshot may corrupt the VM's vmx file, causing the VM to 
           refuse to start. If this is the case, edit your vmx file:
           
           * remove the following line:
               
           ```bash
           checkpoint.vmState = "foo-SnapshotXX.vmsn"
           ```
           
           * edit vmx vmdk (disk) reference:
           ```bash
           # ide0:0.fileName = "foo-XXXXX.vmdk"
           # change to
           ide0:0.fileName = "foo.vmdk"
           ```
