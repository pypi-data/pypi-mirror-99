# AuthAudits

An audit record containing authentication related actions. Each stage of the authentication pipeline emits a record indicating what is going on: who is performing the action, what they are trying to log in to, whether they succeeded, etc. Use this to determine who accessed the system and when, as well as help with troubleshooting authentication issues.
