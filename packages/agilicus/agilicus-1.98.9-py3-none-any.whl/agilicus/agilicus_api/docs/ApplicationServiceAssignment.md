# ApplicationServiceAssignment

An ApplicationServiceAssignment allows an Environment of an Application to access an ApplicationService. Essentially, ApplicationSerivceAssignment models a link between an Environment and an ApplicationService. For example, a collection of these with the same Environment would model the set of ApplicationServices that environment can access. Alternatively, a collection of these with the same ApplicationService would model the set of Environments that can access that ApplicationService. ApplicationServiceAssignments apply to the Organisation of the ApplicationService being assigned.
