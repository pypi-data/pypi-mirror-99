# OIDCProxyScope

An OIDCProxyScope describes a OIDC scope that will be used when authenticating with the configured OIDC provider. 
## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **str** | Each application role represents a scope in the form of urn:agilicus:app:X:Y (X is the app name and Y is the role). The scope can be optional by adding a question mark after the role (e.g. urn:agilicus:app:X:Y?). If the scope is required, users without equivalent roles will be denied access. Otherwise, the user will only be granted the access permission if they have the role.  |
