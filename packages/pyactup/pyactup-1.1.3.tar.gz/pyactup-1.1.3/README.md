PyACTUp is a lightweight Python implementation of a subset of the
ACT-R cognitive architectureâ€™s Declarative Memory, suitable for
incorporating into other Python models and applications. It is
inspired by the ACT-UP cognitive modeling toolbox.

There is [online documentation of PyACTUp](http://halle.psy.cmu.edu/pyactup/),
and the [sources](https://bitbucket.org/dfmorrison/pyactup/) are on Bitbucket.

PyACTUp requires Python version 3.7 or later. PyACTUp also works in
recent versions of PyPy.

Normally, assuming you are connected to the internet, to install
PyACTUp you should simply have to type at the command line

    pip install pyactup

Depending upon various possible variations in how Python and your
machine are configured you may have to modify the above in various
ways

* you may need to ensure your virtual environment is activated
* you may need use an alternative scheme your Python IDE supports
* you may need to call it `pip3` instead of simply `pip`
* you may need to precede the call to `pip` by `sudo`
* you may need to use some combination of the above

If you are unable to install PyACTUp as above, you can instead
download a tarball from
[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/dfmorrison/pyactup/downloads/).
The tarball will have a filename something like `pyactup-1.1.3.tar.gz`.
Assuming this file is at `/some/directory/pyactup-1.1.3.tar.gz` install
it by typing at the command line

    pip install /some/directory/pyactup-1.1.3.tar.gz

Alternatively you can untar the tarball with

    tar -xf /some/directory/pyactup-1.1.3.tar.gz

and then change to the resulting directory and type

    python setup.py install
