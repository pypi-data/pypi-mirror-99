        ``Hillipop`` is a multifrequency CMB likelihood for Planck data. The likelihood is a spectrum-based
        Gaussian approximation for cross-correlation spectra from Planck 100, 143 and 217GHz split-frequency
        maps, with semi-analytic estimates of the Cl covariance matrix based on the data. The cross-spectra
        are debiased from the effects of the mask and the beam leakage using
        [``Xpol``](https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/tristram/Xpol) (a generalization to polarization of the algorithm
        presented in [Tristram et al. 2005](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405575)) before being compared
        to the model, which includes CMB and foreground residuals. They cover the multipoles from &ell;=30
        to &ell;=2500.
        
        The model consists of a linear combination of the CMB power spectrum and several foregrounds
        residuals. These are:
        - Galactic dust (estimated directly from the 353 GHz channel);
        - the cosmic infrared background (as measured in [Planck Collaboration XXX
          2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0382));
        - thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich emission (based on the Planck measurement reported in [Planck
          Collaboration XXI 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5081));
        - kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich emission, including homogeneous and patchy reionization components from
          [Shaw et al. (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0553) and [Battaglia et
          al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2832);
        - a tSZ-CIB correlation consistent with both models above; and
        - unresolved point sources as a Poisson-like power spectrum with two components (extragalactic radio
          galaxies and infrared dusty galaxies).
        
        HiLLiPoP has been used as an alternative to the public Planck likelihood in the 2013 and 2015 Planck
        releases [[Planck Collaboration XV 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5075); [Planck Collaboration XI
        2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02704)], and is described in detail in [Couchot et
        al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09730).
        
        Likelihoods available are ``hillipop.TT``, ``hillipop.EE``, ``hillipop.TE``, ``hillipop.TTTE``, and
        ``hillipop.TTTEEE``.
        
        It is interfaced with the ``cobaya`` MCMC sampler.
        
        Likelihood versions
        -------------------
        
        <!-- * Planck 2018 (PR3) -->
        * Planck 2020 (PR4)
        
        Install
        -------
        The easiest way to install the `Hillipop` likelihood is *via* `pip`
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install planck-2020-hillipop [--user]
        ```
        
        If you plan to dig into the code, it is better to clone this repository to some location
        
        ```shell
        $ git clone https://github.com/planck-npipe/hillipop.git /where/to/clone
        ```
        
        Then you can install the `Hillipop` likelihood and its dependencies *via*
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install -e /where/to/clone
        ```
        
        The ``-e`` option allow the developer to make changes within the `Hillipop` directory without having
        to reinstall at every changes. If you plan to just use the likelihood and do not develop it, you can
        remove the ``-e`` option.
        
        Installing Hillipop likelihood data
        -----------------------------------
        
        The [`examples/hillipop_example.yaml`](examples/hillipop_example.yaml) file is a good starting point to
        know the different nuisance parameters used by `hillipop` likelihoods.
        
        You should use the `cobaya-install` binary to automatically download the data needed by the
        `Hillipop` likelihood
        
        ```shell
        $ cobaya-install /where/to/clone/examples/hillipop_example.yaml -p /where/to/put/packages
        ```
        
        Data and code such as [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB) will be downloaded and installed within
        the ``/where/to/put/packages`` directory. For more details, you can have a look to `cobaya`
        [documentation](https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_cosmo.html).
