Description: Graphics, video, and audio engine for the
                Mission Pinball Framework.
        
                The Mission Pinball Framework Media Controller (MPF-MC) is a component
                of the Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) that controls graphics and
                sound, including dot matrix displays (DMDs), LCD displays, and color
                RGB LED displays.
        
                (The MPF media controller architecture is modular, so you can use this
                MPF-MC package or another one.)
        
                The MPF-MC is built on Kivy and leverages SDL2, OpenGL, and
                GPU-accelerated hardware.
        
                MPF is a work-in-progress that is not yet complete, though we're
                actively developing it and checking in several commits a week. It's
                MIT licensed, actively developed by fun people, and supported by a
                vibrant pinball-loving community.
