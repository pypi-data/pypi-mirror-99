# DracoPy

DracoPy is a Python wrapper for Google's Draco mesh compression library

Available as a PyPI package: pip install DracoPy 

Binary wheels are available for users with Python >= 3.6 and pip >= 20.

Installation from source requires Python >= 3.6, pip >= 10, and a C++ compiler that is fully compatible with C++11.

It supports Linux, OS X, and Windows. 

Windows 3.9 wheels are currently missing until Appveyor supports it, so Windows users are recommended to use Python <= 3.8. 

An example of usage is given in example.py.
