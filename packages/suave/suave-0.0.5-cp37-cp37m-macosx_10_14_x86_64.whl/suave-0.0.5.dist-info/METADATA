`suave`: The Continuous-Function Estimator
==========================================

|PyPI| |MIT licensed| |RTD| |Continuous-Function Estimator Paper| |Corrfunc Paper I| |Corrfunc Paper II|

This is an implementation of the Continuous-Function Estimator, a generalization of the standard (Landy-Szalay) estimator for the two-point correlation function. 
We call this tool ``suave`` which means *smooth* in Spanish (pronounced **swah**-beh), as it can produce smooth (continuous) correlation functions. 
It is built within the `Corrfunc <https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc>`_  package, by Manodeep Sinha and Lehman Garrison; check out the full Corrfunc README at the original repo.

The 2-point correlation function measures the clustering of galaxies (or other tracers) as a function of scale. 
Traditionally, this is done by counting the pairs of galaxies in a given separation bin, and normalizing by the pairs in a uniform random catalog. 

The Continuous-Function Estimator eliminates the need for binning, in separation or any other quantity. 
Rather, it projects the pairs onto any user-defined set of basis functions.
It replaces the pair counts with vectors, and the random normalization vector term with a matrix, that describe the contribution of the pairs to each basis function.
The correlation function can then be directly evaluated at any separation, resulting in a continuous estimation.

An example script for using the estimator is in `example_theory.ipynb <https://github.com/kstoreyf/Corrfunc/blob/master/examples/example_theory.ipynb>`_.
The Continuous-Function Estimator is currently implemented in the DD(s, mu) pair counting statistic for both mock and theory data.
Currently implemented bases are tophat and piecewise.
General r-dependent basis functions can be read in from a file; helper routines for these include spline basis functions of any order and a baryon acoustic oscillation fitting function.

The paper presenting this method can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01836 (Storey-Fisher \& Hogg, Accepted to ApJ).

Installation
============

Pre-requisites
--------------

Suave has most of the same pre-reqs as Corrfunc, as well as a couple more:

- ``make >= 3.80``
- OpenMP capable compiler like ``icc``, ``gcc>=4.6`` or ``clang >= 3.7``. You should already have a system install, but on mac/linux you can install gcc with ``conda install gcc``.
- ``gsl >= 2.4``. Use either ``conda install -c conda-forge gsl`` (MAC/linux) or ``(sudo) port install gsl`` (MAC) to install ``gsl`` if necessary.
- ``python >= 2.7`` or ``python>=3.4`` for compiling the C extensions.
- ``numpy >= 1.7`` for compiling the C extensions.
- ``scipy >= 1.6`` for the spline basis functions for suave (lower versions may work but untested) 
- ``colossus >= 1.2`` for the BAO basis functions for suave (lower versions may work but untested)  
- ``six >= 1.15`` (colossus dependency, lower versions may work but untested)

Install with pip
----------------

You can install suave via pip. We recommend doing this into a clean conda environment. You can do this and install the dependencies with the following set of commands:

::

   $ conda create -n suaveenv
   $ conda activate suaveenv
   $ conda install -c conda-forge gsl numpy scipy six pip
   $ pip install colossus
   $ pip install suave

Install from source
-------------------

You should also be able to install from source. Once again you can do this in a clean conda environment:

::

   $ conda create -n suaveenv
   $ conda activate suaveenv
   $ conda install -c conda-forge gsl numpy scipy six pip
   $ pip install colossus
   $ git clone https://github.com/kstoreyf/suave/
   $ cd suave
   $ make
   $ make install
   $ pip install . (--user)

Author & Maintainers
====================

The suave package was implemented by `Kate Storey-Fisher <https://github.com/kstoreyf>`_.
It is built within Corrfunc, which was designed by Manodeep Sinha and is currently maintained by
`Lehman Garrison <https://github.com/lgarrison>`_ and `Manodeep Sinha <https://github.com/manodeep>`_.

Finally, if you benefit from the enhanced vectorised kernels in ``Corrfunc`` (not currently used in ``suave`` but likely used if you're also using out-of-the-box ``Corrfunc``), then please also cite this paper:
