    Args:
        inputs: Key(s) of images to be modified.
        outputs: Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        color_shift: Variance range for color hue change. Measured as a fraction of 360 degree Hue angle in the HLS
            colorspace.
        intensity: Multiplicative factor that controls the strength of color and luminace noise.
