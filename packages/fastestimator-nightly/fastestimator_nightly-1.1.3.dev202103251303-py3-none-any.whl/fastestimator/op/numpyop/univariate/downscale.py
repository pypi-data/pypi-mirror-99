        inputs: Key(s) of images to be modified.
        outputs: Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        scale_min: Lower bound on the image scale. Should be < 1.
        scale_max:  Upper bound on the image scale. Should be >= scale_min.
        interpolation: cv2 interpolation method.
