    Args:
        inputs: Key(s) of images to be modified.
        outputs: Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument

        gamma_limit: If gamma_limit is a single float value, the range will be (-gamma_limit, gamma_limit).
