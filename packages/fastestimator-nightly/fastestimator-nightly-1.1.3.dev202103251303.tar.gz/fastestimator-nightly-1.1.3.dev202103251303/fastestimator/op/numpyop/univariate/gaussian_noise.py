    WARNING: This assumes that floating point images are in the range [0,1] and will trim the output to that range. If
    your image is in a range like [-0.5, 0.5] then you do not want to use this Op.

    Args:
        inputs: Key(s) of images to be modified.
        outputs: Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
        mode: What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute
            regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument
            like "!infer" or "!train".
        var_limit: Variance range for noise. If var_limit is a single float, the range will be (0, var_limit).
        mean: Mean of the noise.
