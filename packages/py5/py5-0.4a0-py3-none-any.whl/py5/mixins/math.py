        Generates random gaussian values. Each time the ``random_gaussian()`` function
        is called, it returns an unexpected float with a probability distribution set by
        the parameters.  This function's randomness can be influenced by
        :doc:`random_seed`.

        If no parameters are passed to the function, returned values will have an
        average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Although there is theoretically no
        minimum or maximum value that this function might return, in practice returned
        values will be within plus or minus one standard deviation of the mean 68% of
        the time and within two standard devations 95% of the time. Values farther and
        farther from the mean become increasingly less likely.

        If only one parameter is passed to the function, that parameter will be used as
        the average instead of 0. If two parameters are called, those values will be
        used as the average and standard deviation.

        This function makes calls to numpy to generate the random values."""

        Generate pseudo-random noise values for specific coodinates. Noise functions are
        random sequence generators that produce a more natural, harmonic succession of
        numbers compared to the :doc:`random` function. Several well-known noise
        algorithms were developed by Ken Perlin and have been used in graphical
        applications to generate procedural textures, shapes, terrains, and other
        seemingly organic forms.

        In contrast to the :doc:`random` function, noise is defined in an n-dimensional
        space, in which each coordinate corresponds to a fixed pseudo-random value
        (fixed only for the lifespan of the program). Py5 can generate Perlin Noise and
        Simplex Noise. By default, py5 will generate noise using the Simplex Noise
        algorithm. The noise value can be animated by moving through the noise space, as
        demonstrated in the examples. Any dimension can also be interpreted as time. An
        easy way to animate the noise value is to pass the ``noise()`` function the
        :doc:`frame_count` divided by a scaling factor, as is done in a few of the
        examples.

        The generated noise values for both Perlin Noise and Simplex Noise will be
        between -1 and 1. This contrasts with Processing's noise function, which
        typically returns values between 0 and 1.

        Perlin Noise can be generated in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions and Simplex Noise can be
        generated in 1, 2, 3, or 4 dimensions. Technically Simplex Noise cannot be
        generated in only 1 dimension, but as a convenience, py5 will add a second
        dimension for you (with a value of 0) if only one dimension is used.

        The actual noise structure is similar to that of an audio signal, in respect to
        the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in
        physics, both noise algorithms are computed over several octaves which are added
        together for the final result.

        The nature of the noise values returned can be adjusted with :doc:`noise_mode`,
        :doc:`noise_seed`, and :doc:`noise_detail`.

        Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the scale of
        the input coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space, the value
        of the coordinates doesn't matter as such; only the distance between successive
        coordinates is important (such as when using ``noise()`` within a loop). As a
        general rule, the smaller the difference between coordinates, the smoother the
        resulting noise sequence. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most applications,
        but this will differ depending on the use case and the noise settings.

        Py5's noise functionality is provided by the Python noise library. The noise
        library provides more advanced features than what is documented here. To use the
        more advanced features, import that library directly.

        Parameters
        ----------

        mode: int
            kind of noise to generate, either PERLIN_NOISE or SIMPLEX_NOISE

        Notes
        -----

        Sets the kind of noise that the :doc:`noise` function will generate. This can be
        either Perlin Noise or Simplex Noise. By default, py5 will generate noise using
        the Simplex Noise algorithm.

        Perlin Noise can be generated in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions and Simplex Noise can be
        generated in 1, 2, 3, or 4 dimensions. Technically Simplex Noise cannot be
        generated in only 1 dimension, but as a convenience, py5 will add a second
        dimension for you (with a value of 0) if only one dimension is used.

        The specific Perlin Noise implementation provided by py5 is the "Improved Perlin
        Noise" algorithm as described in Ken Perlin's 2002 SIGGRAPH paper. This uses the
        fifth degree polynomial ``f(t)=6t^5-15t^4+10t^3`` as the blending function. This
        is different from the "Classic Perlin Noise" algorithm, described in Ken
        Perlin's 1985 SIGGRAPH paper, which uses the third degree polynomial
        ``f(t)=3t^2-2t^3`` instead. The Simplex Noise algorithm, also developed by Ken
        Perlin, is different from Perlin Noise, and uses a completely different approach
        for generating noise values. Processing's noise algorithm is a valid and useful
        noise algorithm but is not identical to any of the algorithms mentioned here, so
        py5's noise values will not match Processing's no matter what inputs or settings
        are used.

        octaves: float = None
            number of noise octaves

        Notes
        -----

        Adjusts the character and level of detail produced by the :doc:`noise` function.
        Similar to harmonics in physics, noise is computed over several octaves. Lower
        octaves contribute more to the output signal and as such define the overall
        intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves create finer-grained details in
        the noise sequence.

        By default, noise is computed over 4 octaves. Each octave has half the amplitude
        and twice the frequency of its predecessor. The decrease in amplitude can be
        adjusted with the ``persistence`` parameter. The increase in frequency can be
        adjusted with the ``lacunarity`` parameter.

        For example, a ``persistence`` parameter of 0.75 means each octave will now have
        75% impact (25% less) of the previous lower octave. A ``lacunarity`` parameter
        of 4 means that each octave will have 4 times the frequency of the previous
        lower octave, providing noise at a finer-grained scale than what the default
        value of 2 would provide.

        By changing these parameters, the signal created by the :doc:`noise` function
        can be adapted to fit very specific needs and characteristics.
