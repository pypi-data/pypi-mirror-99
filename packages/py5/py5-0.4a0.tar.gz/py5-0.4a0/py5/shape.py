class Py5Shape:
    """Datatype for storing shapes.

    Underlying Java class: PShape.PShape

    Notes
    -----

    Datatype for storing shapes. Before a shape is used, it must be loaded with the
    :doc:`load_shape` or created with the :doc:`create_shape`. The :doc:`shape`
    function is used to draw the shape to the display window. Py5 can currently load
    and display SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and OBJ shapes. OBJ files can only be
    opened using the ``P3D`` renderer. The :doc:`load_shape` function supports SVG
    files created with Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. It is not a full SVG
    implementation, but offers some straightforward support for handling vector
    data. A more complete SVG implementation can be provided by :doc:`convert_image`
    if Cairo is installed. See installation instructions for additional detail.

    The ``Py5Shape`` object contains a group of methods that can operate on the
    shape data.

    To create a new shape, use the :doc:`create_shape` function. Do not use the
    syntax ``Py5Shape()``.

        Notes

        Increases or decreases the size of a shape by expanding and contracting
        vertices. Shapes always scale from the relative origin of their bounding box.
        Scale values are specified as decimal percentages. For example, the method call
        ``scale(2.0)`` increases the dimension of a shape by 200%. Subsequent calls to
        the method multiply the effect. For example, calling ``scale(2.0)`` and then
        ``scale(1.5)`` is the same as ``scale(3.0)``. This transformation is applied
        directly to the shape; it's not refreshed each time ``draw()`` is run.

        Using this method with the ``z`` parameter requires using the ``P3D`` parameter
        in combination with size.

        :doc:`py5shape_end_shape`. However, after the shape is created, only the

        Notes
        -----

        Specifies an amount to displace the shape. The ``x`` parameter specifies
        left/right translation, the ``y`` parameter specifies up/down translation, and
        the ``z`` parameter specifies translations toward/away from the screen.
        Subsequent calls to the method accumulates the effect. For example, calling
        ``translate(50, 0)`` and then ``translate(20, 0)`` is the same as
        ``translate(70, 0)``. This transformation is applied directly to the shape, it's
        not refreshed each time ``draw()`` is run.

        Using this method with the ``z`` parameter requires using the ``P3D`` parameter
        in combination with size.
