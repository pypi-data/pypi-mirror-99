    Extracts the alpha value from a color, scaled to match current

    assign it to an int value.

    The ``alpha()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a
    technique called bit shifting. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can
    achieve the same results as ``alpha()`` but with greater speed by using the
    right shift operator (``>>``) with a bit mask. For example, ``alpha(c)`` and ``c
    >> 24 & 0xFF`` both extract the alpha value from a color variable ``c`` but the
    later is faster.

    Draws an arc to the screen. Arcs are drawn along the outer edge of an ellipse

    ``start`` and ``stop`` parameters to specify the angles (in radians) at which to
    draw the arc. The start/stop values must be in clockwise order.

    There are three ways to draw an arc; the rendering technique used is defined by
    the optional seventh parameter. The three options, depicted in the examples, are
    ``PIE``, ``OPEN``, and ``CHORD``. The default mode is the ``OPEN`` stroke with a
    ``PIE`` fill.

    In some cases, the ``arc()`` function isn't accurate enough for smooth drawing.
    For example, the shape may jitter on screen when rotating slowly. If you're

    The ``begin_camera()`` and :doc:`end_camera` functions enable advanced

    control over camera movement, however for most users, the :doc:`camera` function

    that transformations happen afterwards), and the :doc:`camera` function can be
    used after ``begin_camera()`` if you want to reset the camera before applying
    transformations.

    This function sets the matrix mode to the camera matrix so calls such as
    :doc:`translate`, :doc:`rotate`, :doc:`apply_matrix` and :doc:`reset_matrix`

    Using the ``begin_shape()`` and :doc:`end_shape` functions allow creating more
    complex forms. ``begin_shape()`` begins recording vertices for a shape and
    :doc:`end_shape` stops recording. The value of the ``kind`` parameter tells it
    which types of shapes to create from the provided vertices. With no mode
    specified, the shape can be any irregular polygon. The parameters available for
    ``begin_shape()`` are ``POINTS``, ``LINES``, ``TRIANGLES``, ``TRIANGLE_FAN``,
    ``TRIANGLE_STRIP``, ``QUADS``, and ``QUAD_STRIP``. After calling the
    ``begin_shape()`` function, a series of :doc:`vertex` commands must follow. To
    stop drawing the shape, call :doc:`end_shape`. The :doc:`vertex` function with
    two parameters specifies a position in 2D and the :doc:`vertex` function with
    three parameters specifies a position in 3D. Each shape will be outlined with
    the current stroke color and filled with the fill color.

    Transformations such as :doc:`translate`, :doc:`rotate`, and :doc:`scale` do not
    work within ``begin_shape()``. It is also not possible to use other shapes, such

    Blends a region of pixels from one image into another (or in itself again) with
    full alpha channel support. There is a choice of the following modes to blend
    the source pixels (A) with the ones of pixels in the destination image (B):

    * BLEND: linear interpolation of colors: ``C = A*factor + B``
    * ADD: additive blending with white clip: ``C = min(A*factor + B, 255)``
    * SUBTRACT: subtractive blending with black clip: ``C = max(B - A*factor, 0)``
    * DARKEST: only the darkest color succeeds: ``C = min(A*factor, B)``
    * LIGHTEST: only the lightest color succeeds: ``C = max(A*factor, B)``
    * DIFFERENCE: subtract colors from underlying image.
    * EXCLUSION: similar to ``DIFFERENCE``, but less extreme.
    * MULTIPLY: Multiply the colors, result will always be darker.
    * SCREEN: Opposite multiply, uses inverse values of the colors.
    * OVERLAY: A mix of ``MULTIPLY`` and SCREEN. Multiplies dark values, and screens
    light values.
    * HARD_LIGHT: ``SCREEN`` when greater than 50% gray, ``MULTIPLY`` when lower.
    * SOFT_LIGHT: Mix of ``DARKEST`` and LIGHTEST.  Works like ``OVERLAY``, but not
    as harsh.
    * DODGE: Lightens light tones and increases contrast, ignores darks. Called
    "Color Dodge" in Illustrator and Photoshop.
    * BURN: Darker areas are applied, increasing contrast, ignores lights. Called
    "Color Burn" in Illustrator and Photoshop.

    All modes use the alpha information (highest byte) of source image pixels as the
    blending factor. If the source and destination regions are different sizes, the
    image will be automatically resized to match the destination size. If the

    Blends the pixels in the display window according to a defined mode. There is a

    pixels already in the display window (B). Each pixel's final color is the result
    of applying one of the blend modes with each channel of (A) and (B)
    independently. The red channel is compared with red, green with green, and blue
    with blue.

    * BLEND: linear interpolation of colors: ``C = A*factor + B``. This is the
    default.
    * ADD: additive blending with white clip: ``C = min(A*factor + B, 255)``
    * SUBTRACT: subtractive blending with black clip: ``C = max(B - A*factor, 0)``
    * DARKEST: only the darkest color succeeds: ``C = min(A*factor, B)``
    * LIGHTEST: only the lightest color succeeds: ``C = max(A*factor, B)``

    * SCREEN: opposite multiply, uses inverse values of the colors.
    * REPLACE: the pixels entirely replace the others and don't utilize alpha
    (transparency) values

    We recommend using ``blend_mode()`` and not the previous :doc:`blend` function.
    However, unlike :doc:`blend`, the ``blend_mode()`` function does not support the
    following: ``HARD_LIGHT``, ``SOFT_LIGHT``, ``OVERLAY``, ``DODGE``, ``BURN``. On

    The ``blue()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a
    technique called bit masking. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can
    achieve the same results as ``blue()`` but with greater speed by using a bit
    mask to remove the other color components. For example, ``blue(c)`` and ``c &
    0xFF`` both extract the blue value from a color variable ``c`` but the later is

    After changing the range of values for colors with code like ``color_mode(HSB,

    Changes the way py5 interprets color data. By default, the parameters for
    :doc:`fill`, :doc:`stroke`, :doc:`background`, and :doc:`color` are defined by
    values between 0 and 255 using the ``RGB`` color model. The ``color_mode()``
    function is used to change the numerical range used for specifying colors and to
    switch color systems. For example, calling ``color_mode(RGB, 1.0)`` will specify
    that values are specified between 0 and 1. The limits for defining colors are
    altered by setting the parameters ``max``, ``max1``, ``max2``, ``max3``, and
    ``max_a``.

    After changing the range of values for colors with code like ``color_mode(HSB,
    360, 100, 100)``, those ranges remain in use until they are explicitly changed
    again. For example, after running ``color_mode(HSB, 360, 100, 100)`` and then
    changing back to ``color_mode(RGB)``, the range for R will be 0 to 360 and the
    range for G and B will be 0 to 100. To avoid this, be explicit about the ranges
    when changing the color mode. For instance, instead of ``color_mode(RGB)``,
    write ``color_mode(RGB, 255, 255, 255)``.

    Notes
    -----

    Creates and returns a new ``Py5Graphics`` object. Use this class if you need to
    draw into an off-screen graphics buffer. The first two parameters define the
    width and height in pixels. The third, optional parameter specifies the
    renderer. It can be defined as ``P2D``, ``P3D``, ``PDF``, or SVG. If the third
    parameter isn't used, the default renderer is set. The ``PDF`` and ``SVG``
    renderers require the filename parameter.

    It's important to consider the renderer used with ``create_graphics()`` in
    relation to the main renderer specified in :doc:`size`. For example, it's only
    possible to use ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` with ``create_graphics()`` when one of them
    is defined in :doc:`size`. ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` use OpenGL for drawing, and when
    using an OpenGL renderer it's necessary for the main drawing surface to be
    OpenGL-based. If ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` are used as the renderer in :doc:`size`,
    then any of the options can be used with ``create_graphics()``. If the default
    renderer is used in :doc:`size`, then only the default, ``PDF``, or ``SVG`` can
    be used with ``create_graphics()``.

    It's important to run all drawing functions between the
    :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_draw`. As the exception
    to this rule, :doc:`smooth` should be run on the Py5Graphics object before
    :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw`. See the reference for :doc:`smooth` for more
    detail.

    The ``create_graphics()`` function should almost never be used inside ``draw()``
    because of the memory and time needed to set up the graphics. One-time or
    occasional use during ``draw()`` might be acceptable, but code that calls
    ``create_graphics()`` at 60 frames per second might run out of memory or freeze
    your Sketch.

    Unlike the main drawing surface which is completely opaque, surfaces created
    with ``create_graphics()`` can have transparency. This makes it possible to draw
    into a graphics and maintain the alpha channel. By using :doc:`save` to write a
    ``PNG`` or ``TGA`` file, the transparency of the graphics object will be
    honored.

    Notes
    -----

    Creates and returns a new ``Py5Graphics`` object. Use this class if you need to
    draw into an off-screen graphics buffer. The first two parameters define the
    width and height in pixels. The third, optional parameter specifies the
    renderer. It can be defined as ``P2D``, ``P3D``, ``PDF``, or SVG. If the third
    parameter isn't used, the default renderer is set. The ``PDF`` and ``SVG``
    renderers require the filename parameter.

    It's important to consider the renderer used with ``create_graphics()`` in
    relation to the main renderer specified in :doc:`size`. For example, it's only
    possible to use ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` with ``create_graphics()`` when one of them
    is defined in :doc:`size`. ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` use OpenGL for drawing, and when
    using an OpenGL renderer it's necessary for the main drawing surface to be
    OpenGL-based. If ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` are used as the renderer in :doc:`size`,
    then any of the options can be used with ``create_graphics()``. If the default
    renderer is used in :doc:`size`, then only the default, ``PDF``, or ``SVG`` can
    be used with ``create_graphics()``.

    It's important to run all drawing functions between the
    :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_draw`. As the exception
    to this rule, :doc:`smooth` should be run on the Py5Graphics object before
    :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw`. See the reference for :doc:`smooth` for more
    detail.

    The ``create_graphics()`` function should almost never be used inside ``draw()``
    because of the memory and time needed to set up the graphics. One-time or
    occasional use during ``draw()`` might be acceptable, but code that calls
    ``create_graphics()`` at 60 frames per second might run out of memory or freeze
    your Sketch.

    Unlike the main drawing surface which is completely opaque, surfaces created
    with ``create_graphics()`` can have transparency. This makes it possible to draw
    into a graphics and maintain the alpha channel. By using :doc:`save` to write a
    ``PNG`` or ``TGA`` file, the transparency of the graphics object will be
    honored.

    ----------

    img: Py5Image
        any variable of type Py5Image

    kind: int
        either ARROW, CROSS, HAND, MOVE, TEXT, or WAIT

    x: int
        the horizontal active spot of the cursor

    y: int
        the vertical active spot of the cursor

    Notes
    -----

    Sets the cursor to a predefined symbol or an image, or makes it visible if
    already hidden. If you are trying to set an image as the cursor, the recommended
    size is 16x16 or 32x32 pixels. The values for parameters ``x`` and ``y`` must be
    less than the dimensions of the image.

    Setting or hiding the cursor does not generally work with "Present" mode (when
    running full-screen).

    With the ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` renderers, a generic set of cursors are used
    because the OpenGL renderer doesn't have access to the default cursor images for
    each platform (Processing Issue 3791).

    Notes

    Sets a perspective matrix as defined by the parameters.

    A frustum is a geometric form: a pyramid with its top cut off.  With the
    viewer's eye at the imaginary top of the pyramid, the six planes of the frustum
    act as clipping planes when rendering a 3D view.  Thus, any form inside the
    clipping planes is rendered and visible; anything outside those planes is not
    visible.

    Setting the frustum has the effect of changing the *perspective* with which the
    scene is rendered.  This can be achieved more simply in many cases by using
    :doc:`perspective`.

    Note that the near value must be greater than zero (as the point of the frustum
    "pyramid" cannot converge "behind" the viewer).  Similarly, the far value must
    be greater than the near value (as the "far" plane of the frustum must be
    "farther away" from the viewer than the near plane).

    Works like glFrustum, except it wipes out the current perspective matrix rather
    than multiplying itself with it.

    Parameters

    which: int
        hint to use when rendering Sketch

    Notes
    -----

    This function is used to enable or disable special features that control how
    graphics are drawn. In the course of developing Processing, the developers had
    to make hard decisions about tradeoffs between performance and visual quality.
    They put significant effort into determining what makes most sense for the
    largest number of users, and then use functions like ``hint()`` to allow people
    to tune the settings for their particular Sketch. Implementing a ``hint()`` is a
    last resort that's used when a more elegant solution cannot be found. Some
    options might graduate to standard features instead of hints over time, or be
    added and removed between (major) releases.

    Hints used by the Default Renderer
    ----------------------------------

    * ``ENABLE_STROKE_PURE``: Fixes a problem with shapes that have a stroke and are
    rendered using small steps (for instance, using :doc:`vertex` with points that
    are close to one another), or are drawn at small sizes.

    Hints for use with ``P2D`` and ``P3D``
    --------------------------------------

    * ``DISABLE_OPENGL_ERRORS``: Speeds up the ``P3D`` renderer setting by not
    checking for errors while running.
    * ``DISABLE_TEXTURE_MIPMAPS``: Disable generation of texture mipmaps in ``P2D``
    or ``P3D``. This results in lower quality - but faster - rendering of texture
    images when they appear smaller than their native resolutions (the mipmaps are
    scaled-down versions of a texture that make it look better when drawing it at a
    small size). However, the difference in performance is fairly minor on recent
    desktop video cards.


    Hints for use with ``P3D`` only
    -------------------------------

    * ``DISABLE_DEPTH_MASK``: Disables writing into the depth buffer. This means
    that a shape drawn with this hint can be hidden by another shape drawn later,
    irrespective of their distances to the camera. Note that this is different from
    disabling the depth test. The depth test is still applied, as long as the
    ``DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST`` hint is not called, but the depth values of the objects
    are not recorded. This is useful when drawing a semi-transparent 3D object
    without depth sorting, in order to avoid visual glitches due the faces of the
    object being at different distances from the camera, but still having the object
    properly occluded by the rest of the objects in the scene.
    * ``ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT``: Enable primitive z-sorting of triangles and lines in
    ``P3D``. This can slow performance considerably, and the algorithm is not yet
    perfect.
    * ``DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST``: Disable the zbuffer, allowing you to draw on top of
    everything at will. When depth testing is disabled, items will be drawn to the
    screen sequentially, like a painting. This hint is most often used to draw in
    3D, then draw in 2D on top of it (for instance, to draw GUI controls in 2D on
    top of a 3D interface). When called, this will also clear the depth buffer.
    Restore the default with ``hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_TEST)``, but note that with the
    depth buffer cleared, any 3D drawing that happens later in will ignore existing
    shapes on the screen.
    * ``DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_STROKE``: Forces the ``P3D`` renderer to draw each shape
    (including its strokes) separately, instead of batching them into larger groups
    for better performance. One consequence of this is that 2D items drawn with
    ``P3D`` are correctly stacked on the screen, depending on the order in which
    they were drawn. Otherwise, glitches such as the stroke lines being drawn on top
    of the interior of all the shapes will occur. However, this hint can make
    rendering substantially slower, so it is recommended to use it only when drawing
    a small amount of shapes. For drawing two-dimensional scenes, use the ``P2D``
    renderer instead, which doesn't need the hint to properly stack shapes and their
    strokes.
    * ``ENABLE_STROKE_PERSPECTIVE``: Enables stroke geometry (lines and points) to
    be affected by the perspective, meaning that they will look smaller as they move
    away from the camera.

    filename: str

    Notes
    -----

    Loads a .vlw formatted font into a ``Py5Font`` object. Create a .vlw font with
    the :doc:`create_font_file` function. This tool creates a texture for each
    alphanumeric character and then adds them as a .vlw file to the current Sketch's
    data folder. Because the letters are defined as textures (and not vector data)
    the size at which the fonts are created must be considered in relation to the
    size at which they are drawn. For example, load a 32pt font if the Sketch
    displays the font at 32 pixels or smaller. Conversely, if a 12pt font is loaded
    and displayed at 48pts, the letters will be distorted because the program will
    be stretching a small graphic to a large size.

    Like :doc:`load_image` and other functions that load data, the ``load_font()``
    function should not be used inside ``draw()``, because it will slow down the
    Sketch considerably, as the font will be re-loaded from the disk (or network) on
    each frame. It's recommended to load files inside ``setup()``.

    To load correctly, fonts must be located in the "data" folder of the current
    Sketch. Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local
    computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux,
    or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file
    found on a network.

    If the file is not available or an error occurs, ``None`` will be returned and
    an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt
    the program, however the ``None`` value may cause an error if your code does not
    check whether the value returned is ``None``.

    Use :doc:`create_font` (instead of ``load_font()``) to enable vector data to be
    used with the default renderer setting. This can be helpful when many font sizes
    are needed, or when using any renderer based on the default renderer, such as

    Rotates the amount specified by the ``angle`` parameter. Angles must be
    specified in radians (values from ``0`` to ``TWO_PI``), or they can be converted
    from degrees to radians with the :doc:`radians` function.

    The coordinates are always rotated around their relative position to the origin.
    Positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction and negative numbers
    rotate in the couterclockwise direction. Transformations apply to everything
    that happens afterward, and subsequent calls to the function compound the
    effect. For example, calling ``rotate(PI/2.0)`` once and then calling
    ``rotate(PI/2.0)`` a second time is the same as a single ``rotate(PI)``. All
    tranformations are reset when ``draw()`` begins again.

    Technically, ``rotate()`` multiplies the current transformation matrix by a
    rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by :doc:`push_matrix`
    and :doc:`pop_matrix`.

    Notes
    -----

    Defines the dimension of the display window width and height in units of pixels.
    This must be called from the ``settings()`` function.

    The built-in variables :doc:`width` and :doc:`height` are set by the parameters
    passed to this function. For example, running ``size(640, 480)`` will assign 640
    to the :doc:`width` variable and 480 to the height ``variable``. If ``size()``
    is not used, the window will be given a default size of 100 x 100 pixels.

    The ``size()`` function can only be used once inside a Sketch, and it cannot be
    used for resizing.

    To run a Sketch at the full dimensions of a screen, use the :doc:`full_screen`
    function, rather than the older way of using ``size(display_width,
    display_height)``.

    The maximum width and height is limited by your operating system, and is usually
    the width and height of your actual screen. On some machines it may simply be
    the number of pixels on your current screen, meaning that a screen of 800 x 600
    could support ``size(1600, 300)``, since that is the same number of pixels. This
    varies widely, so you'll have to try different rendering modes and sizes until
    you get what you're looking for. If you need something larger, use
    ``create_graphics`` to create a non-visible drawing surface.

    The minimum width and height is around 100 pixels in each direction. This is the
    smallest that is supported across Windows, macOS, and Linux. We enforce the
    minimum size so that Sketches will run identically on different machines.

    The ``renderer`` parameter selects which rendering engine to use. For example,
    if you will be drawing 3D shapes, use ``P3D``. In addition to the default
    renderer, other renderers are:

    * ``P2D`` (Processing 2D): 2D graphics renderer that makes use of OpenGL-
    compatible graphics hardware.
    * ``P3D`` (Processing 3D): 3D graphics renderer that makes use of OpenGL-
    compatible graphics hardware.
    * ``FX2D`` (JavaFX 2D): A 2D renderer that uses JavaFX, which may be faster for
    some applications, but has some compatibility quirks.
    * ``PDF``: The ``PDF`` renderer draws 2D graphics directly to an Acrobat PDF
    file. This produces excellent results when you need vector shapes for high-
    resolution output or printing.
    * ``SVG``: The ``SVG`` renderer draws 2D graphics directly to an SVG file. This
    is great for importing into other vector programs or using for digital

    smoothness. This is the level of over sampling applied to the graphics buffer.

    With the ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` renderers, ``smooth(2)`` is the default, this is
    called "2x anti-aliasing." The code ``smooth(4)`` is used for 4x anti-aliasing

    level is determined by the hardware of the machine that is running the software,
    so ``smooth(4)`` and ``smooth(8)`` will not work with every computer.

    The default renderer uses ``smooth(3)`` by default. This is bicubic smoothing.
    The other option for the default renderer is ``smooth(2)``, which is bilinear
    smoothing.

    The ``smooth()`` function can only be set once within a Sketch. It must be

    Draws text to the screen. Displays the information specified in the first
    parameter on the screen in the position specified by the additional parameters.
    A default font will be used unless a font is set with the :doc:`text_font`
    function and a default size will be used unless a font is set with
    :doc:`text_size`. Change the color of the text with the :doc:`fill` function.
    The text displays in relation to the :doc:`text_align` function, which gives the
    option to draw to the left, right, and center of the coordinates.

    The ``x2`` and ``y2`` parameters define a rectangular area to display within and
    may only be used with string data. When these parameters are specified, they are
    interpreted based on the current :doc:`rect_mode` setting. Text that does not
    fit completely within the rectangle specified will not be drawn to the screen.

    Note that py5 lets you call ``text()`` without first specifying a Py5Font with
    :doc:`text_font`. In that case, a generic sans-serif font will be used instead.

    Parameters
    ----------

    align_y: int

    Notes
    -----

    Sets the current alignment for drawing text. The parameters ``LEFT``,
    ``CENTER``, and ``RIGHT`` set the display characteristics of the letters in
    relation to the values for the ``x`` and ``y`` parameters of the :doc:`text`
    function.

    An optional second parameter can be used to vertically align the text.
    ``BASELINE`` is the default, and the vertical alignment will be reset to
    ``BASELINE`` if the second parameter is not used. The ``TOP`` and ``CENTER``
    parameters are straightforward. The ``BOTTOM`` parameter offsets the line based
    on the current :doc:`text_descent`. For multiple lines, the final line will be
    aligned to the bottom, with the previous lines appearing above it.

    When using :doc:`text` with width and height parameters, ``BASELINE`` is
    ignored, and treated as ``TOP``. (Otherwise, text would by default draw outside
    the box, since ``BASELINE`` is the default setting. ``BASELINE`` is not a useful
    drawing mode for text drawn in a rectangle.)

    The vertical alignment is based on the value of :doc:`text_ascent`, which many
    fonts do not specify correctly. It may be necessary to use a hack and offset by
    a few pixels by hand so that the offset looks correct. To do this as less of a

    make an image 50% transparent (assuming the default alpha range of 0-255, which
    can be changed with :doc:`color_mode`).

    Generates random integers. Each time the ``random_int()`` function is called, it
    returns an unexpected integer within the specified range. This function's
    randomness can be influenced by :doc:`random_seed`.

    If no parameters are passed to the function, it will return either 0 or 1.
    Recall that in a Python boolean expression, 0 evaluates to ``False`` and 1
    evaluates to ``True``. This is equivalent to a coin toss.

    If only one parameter is passed to the function, it will return an integer
    between zero and the value of the ``high`` parameter, inclusive. For example,
    ``random(5)`` returns one of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

    If two parameters are specified, the function will return an integer with a
    value between the two values, inclusive. For example, ``random(2, 5)`` returns
    one of 2, 3, 4, or 5.

    If you want to pick a random object from a list, recall that Python uses zero-
    indexing, so the first index value is 0 and the final index value is one less
    than the list length. Therefore, to pick a random index to use in the list
    ``words``, your code should be ``random_int(len(words)-1)``. Omitting the ``-1``
    will (occasionally) result in an index out of range error. Alternatively, you
    can also use :doc:`random_choice` to pick a random object from a list.

    This function makes calls to numpy to generate the random integers.

    Notes
    -----

    Generate pseudo-random noise values for specific coodinates. Noise functions are
    random sequence generators that produce a more natural, harmonic succession of
    numbers compared to the :doc:`random` function. Several well-known noise
    algorithms were developed by Ken Perlin and have been used in graphical
    applications to generate procedural textures, shapes, terrains, and other
    seemingly organic forms.

    In contrast to the :doc:`random` function, noise is defined in an n-dimensional
    space, in which each coordinate corresponds to a fixed pseudo-random value
    (fixed only for the lifespan of the program). Py5 can generate Perlin Noise and
    Simplex Noise. By default, py5 will generate noise using the Simplex Noise
    algorithm. The noise value can be animated by moving through the noise space, as
    demonstrated in the examples. Any dimension can also be interpreted as time. An
    easy way to animate the noise value is to pass the ``noise()`` function the
    :doc:`frame_count` divided by a scaling factor, as is done in a few of the
    examples.

    The generated noise values for both Perlin Noise and Simplex Noise will be
    between -1 and 1. This contrasts with Processing's noise function, which
    typically returns values between 0 and 1.

    Perlin Noise can be generated in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions and Simplex Noise can be
    generated in 1, 2, 3, or 4 dimensions. Technically Simplex Noise cannot be
    generated in only 1 dimension, but as a convenience, py5 will add a second
    dimension for you (with a value of 0) if only one dimension is used.

    The actual noise structure is similar to that of an audio signal, in respect to
    the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in
    physics, both noise algorithms are computed over several octaves which are added
    together for the final result.

    The nature of the noise values returned can be adjusted with :doc:`noise_mode`,
    :doc:`noise_seed`, and :doc:`noise_detail`.

    Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the scale of
    the input coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space, the value
    of the coordinates doesn't matter as such; only the distance between successive
    coordinates is important (such as when using ``noise()`` within a loop). As a
    general rule, the smaller the difference between coordinates, the smoother the
    resulting noise sequence. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most applications,
    but this will differ depending on the use case and the noise settings.

    Py5's noise functionality is provided by the Python noise library. The noise
    library provides more advanced features than what is documented here. To use the
    more advanced features, import that library directly.

    Py5's ``noise()`` function can also accept numpy arrays as parameters. It will
    automatically vectorize the operations and use broadcasting when needed.

    generated in 1, 2, 3, or 4 dimensions. Technically Simplex Noise cannot be
    generated in only 1 dimension, but as a convenience, py5 will add a second
    dimension for you (with a value of 0) if only one dimension is used.

    The actual noise structure is similar to that of an audio signal, in respect to
    the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in
    physics, both noise algorithms are computed over several octaves which are added
    together for the final result.

    The nature of the noise values returned can be adjusted with :doc:`noise_mode`,
    :doc:`noise_seed`, and :doc:`noise_detail`.

    Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the scale of
    the input coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space, the value
    of the coordinates doesn't matter as such; only the distance between successive
    coordinates is important (such as when using ``noise()`` within a loop). As a
    general rule, the smaller the difference between coordinates, the smoother the
    resulting noise sequence. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most applications,
    but this will differ depending on the use case and the noise settings.

    Py5's noise functionality is provided by the Python noise library. The noise
    library provides more advanced features than what is documented here. To use the
    more advanced features, import that library directly.

    Py5's ``noise()`` function can also accept numpy arrays as parameters. It will
    automatically vectorize the operations and use broadcasting when needed.

    Parameters
    ----------

    mode: int
        kind of noise to generate, either PERLIN_NOISE or SIMPLEX_NOISE

    Notes
    -----

    Sets the kind of noise that the :doc:`noise` function will generate. This can be
    either Perlin Noise or Simplex Noise. By default, py5 will generate noise using
    the Simplex Noise algorithm.

    Perlin Noise can be generated in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions and Simplex Noise can be

    dimension for you (with a value of 0) if only one dimension is used.

    The specific Perlin Noise implementation provided by py5 is the "Improved Perlin
    Noise" algorithm as described in Ken Perlin's 2002 SIGGRAPH paper. This uses the
    fifth degree polynomial ``f(t)=6t^5-15t^4+10t^3`` as the blending function. This
    is different from the "Classic Perlin Noise" algorithm, described in Ken
    Perlin's 1985 SIGGRAPH paper, which uses the third degree polynomial
    ``f(t)=3t^2-2t^3`` instead. The Simplex Noise algorithm, also developed by Ken
    Perlin, is different from Perlin Noise, and uses a completely different approach
    for generating noise values. Processing's noise algorithm is a valid and useful
    noise algorithm but is not identical to any of the algorithms mentioned here, so
    py5's noise values will not match Processing's no matter what inputs or settings
    are used.

        number of noise octaves

    persistence: float = None

    Notes
    -----

    Adjusts the character and level of detail produced by the :doc:`noise` function.
    Similar to harmonics in physics, noise is computed over several octaves. Lower
    octaves contribute more to the output signal and as such define the overall
    intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves create finer-grained details in
    the noise sequence.

    By default, noise is computed over 4 octaves. Each octave has half the amplitude
    and twice the frequency of its predecessor. The decrease in amplitude can be
    adjusted with the ``persistence`` parameter. The increase in frequency can be
    adjusted with the ``lacunarity`` parameter.

    For example, a ``persistence`` parameter of 0.75 means each octave will now have
    75% impact (25% less) of the previous lower octave. A ``lacunarity`` parameter
    of 4 means that each octave will have 4 times the frequency of the previous
    lower octave, providing noise at a finer-grained scale than what the default
    value of 2 would provide.

    By changing these parameters, the signal created by the :doc:`noise` function
    can be adapted to fit very specific needs and characteristics.
