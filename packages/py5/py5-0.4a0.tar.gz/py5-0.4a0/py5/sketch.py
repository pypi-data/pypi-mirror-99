        Run the Sketch. Code in the ``settings``, ``setup``, and ``draw`` functions will
        be used to actualize your Sketch.

        Use the ``block`` parameter to specify if the call to ``run_sketch`` should
        return immediately or block until the Sketch exits. If the ``block`` parameter
        is not specified, py5 will first attempt to determine if the Sketch is running
        in a Jupyter Notebook or an IPython shell. If it is, ``block`` will default to
        ``False``, and ``True`` otherwise.

        A list of strings passed to ``py5_options`` will be passed to the Processing
        PApplet class as arguments to specify characteristics such as the window's
        location on the screen. A list of strings passed to ``sketch_args`` will be

        files from disk, it reads image data from other Python objects.

        Passed image object types must be known to py5's builtin image conversion tools.
        New object types and functions to effect conversions can be registered with
        :doc:`register_image_conversion`.

        The caller can optionally pass an existing Py5Image object to put the converted
        image into. This can have performance benefits in code that would otherwise

        When checking for these keys, it can be useful to first check if the key is

        For those familiar with Java, the values for ``UP`` and ``DOWN`` are simply
        shorter versions of Java's ``key_event.VK_UP`` and ``key_event.VK_DOWN``. Other
        ``key_code`` values can be found in the Java KeyEvent reference.

        ``mouse_pressed()`` and ``mouse_moved()``. Inside ``draw()``, ``pmouse_x`` and
        :doc:`pmouse_y` update only once per frame (once per trip through the ``draw()``
        loop). But inside mouse events, they update each time the event is called. If
        these values weren't updated immediately during mouse events, then the mouse
        position would be read only once per frame, resulting in slight delays and
        choppy interaction. If the mouse variables were always updated multiple times
        per frame, then something like ``line(pmouse_x, pmouse_y, mouse_x, mouse_y)``
        inside ``draw()`` would have lots of gaps, because ``pmouse_x`` may have changed
        several times in between the calls to :doc:`line`.

        If you want values relative to the previous frame, use ``pmouse_x`` and
        :doc:`pmouse_y` inside ``draw()``. If you want continuous response, use
        ``pmouse_x`` and :doc:`pmouse_y` inside the mouse event functions.

        There are three ways to draw an arc; the rendering technique used is defined by

        Notes
        -----

        The ``background()`` function sets the color used for the background of the py5
        window. The default background is light gray. This function is typically used
        within ``draw()`` to clear the display window at the beginning of each frame,
        but it can be used inside ``setup()`` to set the background on the first frame
        of animation or if the backgound need only be set once.

        An image can also be used as the background for a Sketch, although the image's
        width and height must match that of the Sketch window. Images used with
        ``background()`` will ignore the current :doc:`tint` setting. To resize an image
        to the size of the Sketch window, use ``image.resize(width, height)``.

        It is not possible to use the transparency ``alpha`` parameter with background
        colors on the main drawing surface. It can only be used along with a
        ``Py5Graphics`` object and :doc:`create_graphics`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        alpha: float
            opacity of the background

        gray: float
            specifies a value between white and black

        image: Py5Image
            Py5Image to set as background (must be same size as the Sketch window)

        rgb: int
            any value of the color datatype

        v1: float
            red or hue value (depending on the current color mode)

        v2: float
            green or saturation value (depending on the current color mode)

        v3: float
            blue or brightness value (depending on the current color mode)

        Notes
        -----

        The ``background()`` function sets the color used for the background of the py5
        window. The default background is light gray. This function is typically used
        within ``draw()`` to clear the display window at the beginning of each frame,
        but it can be used inside ``setup()`` to set the background on the first frame
        of animation or if the backgound need only be set once.

        An image can also be used as the background for a Sketch, although the image's
        width and height must match that of the Sketch window. Images used with
        ``background()`` will ignore the current :doc:`tint` setting. To resize an image
        to the size of the Sketch window, use ``image.resize(width, height)``.

        It is not possible to use the transparency ``alpha`` parameter with background
        colors on the main drawing surface. It can only be used along with a
        ``Py5Graphics`` object and :doc:`create_graphics`.

        control over camera movement, however for most users, the :doc:`camera` function

        they will not automatically replace the camera transform itself. For this
        reason, camera functions should be placed at the beginning of ``draw()`` (so
        that transformations happen afterwards), and the :doc:`camera` function can be
        used after ``begin_camera()`` if you want to reset the camera before applying
        transformations.

        This function sets the matrix mode to the camera matrix so calls such as
        :doc:`translate`, :doc:`rotate`, :doc:`apply_matrix` and :doc:`reset_matrix`

        Notes
        -----

        To create vectors from 3D data, use the ``begin_raw()`` and :doc:`end_raw`
        commands. These commands will grab the shape data just before it is rendered to
        the screen. At this stage, your entire scene is nothing but a long list of
        individual lines and triangles. This means that a shape created with
        :doc:`sphere` function will be made up of hundreds of triangles, rather than a
        single object. Or that a multi-segment line shape (such as a curve) will be
        rendered as individual segments.

        When using ``begin_raw()`` and :doc:`end_raw`, it's possible to write to either
        a 2D or 3D renderer. For instance, ``begin_raw()`` with the ``PDF`` library will
        write the geometry as flattened triangles and lines, even if recording from the
        ``P3D`` renderer.

        If you want a background to show up in your files, use ``rect(0, 0, width,
        height)`` after setting the :doc:`fill` to the background color. Otherwise the
        background will not be rendered to the file because the background is not shape.

        Using ``hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT)`` can improve the appearance of 3D geometry
        drawn to 2D file formats.

        filename: str

        raw_graphics: Py5Graphics
            Py5Graphics object to apply draw commands to

        Notes
        -----

        To create vectors from 3D data, use the ``begin_raw()`` and :doc:`end_raw`
        commands. These commands will grab the shape data just before it is rendered to
        the screen. At this stage, your entire scene is nothing but a long list of
        individual lines and triangles. This means that a shape created with
        :doc:`sphere` function will be made up of hundreds of triangles, rather than a
        single object. Or that a multi-segment line shape (such as a curve) will be
        rendered as individual segments.

        When using ``begin_raw()`` and :doc:`end_raw`, it's possible to write to either
        a 2D or 3D renderer. For instance, ``begin_raw()`` with the ``PDF`` library will
        write the geometry as flattened triangles and lines, even if recording from the
        ``P3D`` renderer.

        If you want a background to show up in your files, use ``rect(0, 0, width,
        height)`` after setting the :doc:`fill` to the background color. Otherwise the
        background will not be rendered to the file because the background is not shape.

        Using ``hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT)`` can improve the appearance of 3D geometry
        drawn to 2D file formats.

        choice of the following modes to blend the source pixels (A) with the ones of
        pixels already in the display window (B). Each pixel's final color is the result
        of applying one of the blend modes with each channel of (A) and (B)
        independently. The red channel is compared with red, green with green, and blue
        with blue.

        * BLEND: linear interpolation of colors: ``C = A*factor + B``. This is the
        default.
        * ADD: additive blending with white clip: ``C = min(A*factor + B, 255)``
        * SUBTRACT: subtractive blending with black clip: ``C = max(B - A*factor, 0)``
        * DARKEST: only the darkest color succeeds: ``C = min(A*factor, B)``
        * LIGHTEST: only the lightest color succeeds: ``C = max(A*factor, B)``
        * DIFFERENCE: subtract colors from underlying image.
        * EXCLUSION: similar to ``DIFFERENCE``, but less extreme.
        * MULTIPLY: multiply the colors, result will always be darker.
        * SCREEN: opposite multiply, uses inverse values of the colors.
        * REPLACE: the pixels entirely replace the others and don't utilize alpha
        (transparency) values

        We recommend using ``blend_mode()`` and not the previous :doc:`blend` function.
        However, unlike :doc:`blend`, the ``blend_mode()`` function does not support the
        following: ``HARD_LIGHT``, ``SOFT_LIGHT``, ``OVERLAY``, ``DODGE``, ``BURN``. On
        older hardware, the ``LIGHTEST``, ``DARKEST``, and ``DIFFERENCE`` modes might
        not be available as well.

        The value is always returned as a float, so be careful not to assign it to an
        int value.

        The ``blue()`` function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower than a
        technique called bit masking. When working in ``color_mode(RGB, 255)``, you can
        achieve the same results as ``blue()`` but with greater speed by using a bit
        mask to remove the other color components. For example, ``blue(c)`` and ``c &
        0xFF`` both extract the blue value from a color variable ``c`` but the later is
        faster.

        Creates and returns a new ``Py5Graphics`` object. Use this class if you need to
        draw into an off-screen graphics buffer. The first two parameters define the
        width and height in pixels. The third, optional parameter specifies the
        renderer. It can be defined as ``P2D``, ``P3D``, ``PDF``, or SVG. If the third
        parameter isn't used, the default renderer is set. The ``PDF`` and ``SVG``
        renderers require the filename parameter.

        It's important to consider the renderer used with ``create_graphics()`` in
        relation to the main renderer specified in :doc:`size`. For example, it's only
        possible to use ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` with ``create_graphics()`` when one of them
        is defined in :doc:`size`. ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` use OpenGL for drawing, and when
        using an OpenGL renderer it's necessary for the main drawing surface to be
        OpenGL-based. If ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` are used as the renderer in :doc:`size`,
        then any of the options can be used with ``create_graphics()``. If the default
        renderer is used in :doc:`size`, then only the default, ``PDF``, or ``SVG`` can
        be used with ``create_graphics()``.

        It's important to run all drawing functions between the
        :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_draw`. As the exception
        to this rule, :doc:`smooth` should be run on the Py5Graphics object before
        :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw`. See the reference for :doc:`smooth` for more
        detail.

        The ``create_graphics()`` function should almost never be used inside ``draw()``
        because of the memory and time needed to set up the graphics. One-time or
        occasional use during ``draw()`` might be acceptable, but code that calls
        ``create_graphics()`` at 60 frames per second might run out of memory or freeze
        your Sketch.

        Unlike the main drawing surface which is completely opaque, surfaces created
        with ``create_graphics()`` can have transparency. This makes it possible to draw
        into a graphics and maintain the alpha channel. By using :doc:`save` to write a
        ``PNG`` or ``TGA`` file, the transparency of the graphics object will be
        honored.

        The ``create_shape()`` function is used to define a new shape. Once created,
        this shape can be drawn with the :doc:`shape` function. The basic way to use the
        function defines new primitive shapes. One of the following parameters are used
        as the first parameter: ``ELLIPSE``, ``RECT``, ``ARC``, ``TRIANGLE``,
        ``SPHERE``, ``BOX``, ``QUAD``, or ``LINE``. The parameters for each of these
        different shapes are the same as their corresponding functions: :doc:`ellipse`,
        :doc:`rect`, :doc:`arc`, :doc:`triangle`, :doc:`sphere`, :doc:`box`,
        :doc:`quad`, and :doc:`line`. The first example clarifies how this works.

        Custom, unique shapes can be made by using ``create_shape()`` without a
        parameter. After the shape is started, the drawing attributes and geometry can
        be set directly to the shape within the :doc:`begin_shape` and :doc:`end_shape`
        methods. See the second example for specifics, and the reference for
        :doc:`begin_shape` for all of its options.

        The  ``create_shape()`` function can also be used to make a complex shape made
        of other shapes. This is called a "group" and it's created by using the
        parameter ``GROUP`` as the first parameter. See the fourth example to see how it
        works.

        After using ``create_shape()``, stroke and fill color can be set by calling
        methods like :doc:`py5shape_set_fill` and :doc:`py5shape_set_stroke`, as seen in
        the examples. The complete list of methods and fields for the :doc:`py5shape`

        -----

        Sets the color used to fill shapes. For example, if you run ``fill(204, 102,
        0)``, all subsequent shapes will be filled with orange. This color is either
        specified in terms of the ``RGB`` or ``HSB`` color depending on the current
        :doc:`color_mode`. The default color space is ``RGB``, with each value in the
        range from 0 to 255.

        When using hexadecimal notation to specify a color, use "``0x``" before the
        values (e.g., ``0xFFCCFFAA``). The hexadecimal value must be specified with
        eight characters; the first two characters define the alpha component, and the
        remainder define the red, green, and blue components.

        The value for the "gray" parameter must be less than or equal to the current
        maximum value as specified by :doc:`color_mode`. The default maximum value is
        255.

        To change the color of an image or a texture, use :doc:`tint`.

        A frustum is a geometric form: a pyramid with its top cut off.  With the
        viewer's eye at the imaginary top of the pyramid, the six planes of the frustum
        act as clipping planes when rendering a 3D view.  Thus, any form inside the
        clipping planes is rendered and visible; anything outside those planes is not
        visible.

        Setting the frustum has the effect of changing the *perspective* with which the
        scene is rendered.  This can be achieved more simply in many cases by using
        :doc:`perspective`.

        Note that the near value must be greater than zero (as the point of the frustum
        "pyramid" cannot converge "behind" the viewer).  Similarly, the far value must
        be greater than the near value (as the "far" plane of the frustum must be
        "farther away" from the viewer than the near plane).

        Works like glFrustum, except it wipes out the current perspective matrix rather
        than multiplying itself with it.

        ----------

        display: int
            the screen to run the Sketch on (1, 2, 3, etc. or on multiple screens using SPAN)

        renderer: str
            the renderer to use, e.g. P2D, P3D, JAVA2D (default)

        Notes
        -----

        Open a Sketch using the full size of the computer's display. This function must
        be called in ``settings()``. The :doc:`size` and ``full_screen()`` functions
        cannot both be used in the same program.

        When ``full_screen()`` is used without a parameter on a computer with multiple
        monitors, it will (probably) draw the Sketch to the primary display. When it is
        used with a single parameter, this number defines the screen to display to
        program on (e.g. 1, 2, 3...). When used with two parameters, the first defines
        the renderer to use (e.g. P2D) and the second defines the screen. The ``SPAN``
        parameter can be used in place of a screen number to draw the Sketch as a full-
        screen window across all of the attached displays if there are more than one.

        If the pixel requested is outside of the image window, black is returned. The

        -----

        This function is used to enable or disable special features that control how
        graphics are drawn. In the course of developing Processing, the developers had
        to make hard decisions about tradeoffs between performance and visual quality.
        They put significant effort into determining what makes most sense for the
        largest number of users, and then use functions like ``hint()`` to allow people
        to tune the settings for their particular Sketch. Implementing a ``hint()`` is a
        last resort that's used when a more elegant solution cannot be found. Some
        options might graduate to standard features instead of hints over time, or be
        added and removed between (major) releases.

        Hints used by the Default Renderer
        ----------------------------------

        * ``ENABLE_STROKE_PURE``: Fixes a problem with shapes that have a stroke and are
        rendered using small steps (for instance, using :doc:`vertex` with points that
        are close to one another), or are drawn at small sizes.

        Hints for use with ``P2D`` and ``P3D``
        --------------------------------------

        * ``DISABLE_OPENGL_ERRORS``: Speeds up the ``P3D`` renderer setting by not
        checking for errors while running.
        * ``DISABLE_TEXTURE_MIPMAPS``: Disable generation of texture mipmaps in ``P2D``
        or ``P3D``. This results in lower quality - but faster - rendering of texture
        images when they appear smaller than their native resolutions (the mipmaps are
        scaled-down versions of a texture that make it look better when drawing it at a
        small size). However, the difference in performance is fairly minor on recent
        desktop video cards.


        Hints for use with ``P3D`` only
        -------------------------------

        * ``DISABLE_DEPTH_MASK``: Disables writing into the depth buffer. This means
        that a shape drawn with this hint can be hidden by another shape drawn later,
        irrespective of their distances to the camera. Note that this is different from
        disabling the depth test. The depth test is still applied, as long as the
        ``DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST`` hint is not called, but the depth values of the objects
        are not recorded. This is useful when drawing a semi-transparent 3D object
        without depth sorting, in order to avoid visual glitches due the faces of the
        object being at different distances from the camera, but still having the object
        properly occluded by the rest of the objects in the scene.
        * ``ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT``: Enable primitive z-sorting of triangles and lines in
        ``P3D``. This can slow performance considerably, and the algorithm is not yet
        perfect.
        * ``DISABLE_DEPTH_TEST``: Disable the zbuffer, allowing you to draw on top of
        everything at will. When depth testing is disabled, items will be drawn to the
        screen sequentially, like a painting. This hint is most often used to draw in
        3D, then draw in 2D on top of it (for instance, to draw GUI controls in 2D on
        top of a 3D interface). When called, this will also clear the depth buffer.
        Restore the default with ``hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_TEST)``, but note that with the
        depth buffer cleared, any 3D drawing that happens later in will ignore existing
        shapes on the screen.
        * ``DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_STROKE``: Forces the ``P3D`` renderer to draw each shape
        (including its strokes) separately, instead of batching them into larger groups
        for better performance. One consequence of this is that 2D items drawn with
        ``P3D`` are correctly stacked on the screen, depending on the order in which
        they were drawn. Otherwise, glitches such as the stroke lines being drawn on top
        of the interior of all the shapes will occur. However, this hint can make
        rendering substantially slower, so it is recommended to use it only when drawing
        a small amount of shapes. For drawing two-dimensional scenes, use the ``P2D``
        renderer instead, which doesn't need the hint to properly stack shapes and their
        strokes.
        * ``ENABLE_STROKE_PERSPECTIVE``: Enables stroke geometry (lines and points) to
        be affected by the perspective, meaning that they will look smaller as they move
        away from the camera.

        Notes
        -----

        Loads a .vlw formatted font into a ``Py5Font`` object. Create a .vlw font with
        the :doc:`create_font_file` function. This tool creates a texture for each
        alphanumeric character and then adds them as a .vlw file to the current Sketch's
        data folder. Because the letters are defined as textures (and not vector data)
        the size at which the fonts are created must be considered in relation to the
        size at which they are drawn. For example, load a 32pt font if the Sketch
        displays the font at 32 pixels or smaller. Conversely, if a 12pt font is loaded
        and displayed at 48pts, the letters will be distorted because the program will
        be stretching a small graphic to a large size.

        Like :doc:`load_image` and other functions that load data, the ``load_font()``
        function should not be used inside ``draw()``, because it will slow down the
        Sketch considerably, as the font will be re-loaded from the disk (or network) on
        each frame. It's recommended to load files inside ``setup()``.

        To load correctly, fonts must be located in the "data" folder of the current
        Sketch. Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local
        computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux,
        or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file
        found on a network.

        If the file is not available or an error occurs, ``None`` will be returned and
        an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt
        the program, however the ``None`` value may cause an error if your code does not
        check whether the value returned is ``None``.

        Use :doc:`create_font` (instead of ``load_font()``) to enable vector data to be
        used with the default renderer setting. This can be helpful when many font sizes
        are needed, or when using any renderer based on the default renderer, such as
        the ``PDF`` renderer.

        point of a Bezier curve, adding a new segment to a line or shape. The first time

        prefaced with a call to :doc:`vertex` to set the first anchor point. This

        when there is no ``MODE`` parameter specified to :doc:`begin_shape`. Using the
        3D version requires rendering with ``P3D``.

        Notes
        -----

        Defines the dimension of the display window width and height in units of pixels.
        This must be called from the ``settings()`` function.

        The built-in variables :doc:`width` and :doc:`height` are set by the parameters
        passed to this function. For example, running ``size(640, 480)`` will assign 640
        to the :doc:`width` variable and 480 to the height ``variable``. If ``size()``
        is not used, the window will be given a default size of 100 x 100 pixels.

        The ``size()`` function can only be used once inside a Sketch, and it cannot be
        used for resizing.

        To run a Sketch at the full dimensions of a screen, use the :doc:`full_screen`
        function, rather than the older way of using ``size(display_width,
        display_height)``.

        The maximum width and height is limited by your operating system, and is usually
        the width and height of your actual screen. On some machines it may simply be
        the number of pixels on your current screen, meaning that a screen of 800 x 600
        could support ``size(1600, 300)``, since that is the same number of pixels. This
        varies widely, so you'll have to try different rendering modes and sizes until
        you get what you're looking for. If you need something larger, use
        ``create_graphics`` to create a non-visible drawing surface.

        The minimum width and height is around 100 pixels in each direction. This is the
        smallest that is supported across Windows, macOS, and Linux. We enforce the
        minimum size so that Sketches will run identically on different machines.

        The ``renderer`` parameter selects which rendering engine to use. For example,
        if you will be drawing 3D shapes, use ``P3D``. In addition to the default
        renderer, other renderers are:

        * ``P2D`` (Processing 2D): 2D graphics renderer that makes use of OpenGL-
        compatible graphics hardware.
        * ``P3D`` (Processing 3D): 3D graphics renderer that makes use of OpenGL-
        compatible graphics hardware.
        * ``FX2D`` (JavaFX 2D): A 2D renderer that uses JavaFX, which may be faster for
        some applications, but has some compatibility quirks.
        * ``PDF``: The ``PDF`` renderer draws 2D graphics directly to an Acrobat PDF
        file. This produces excellent results when you need vector shapes for high-
        resolution output or printing.
        * ``SVG``: The ``SVG`` renderer draws 2D graphics directly to an SVG file. This
        is great for importing into other vector programs or using for digital
        fabrication.

        Defines the dimension of the display window width and height in units of pixels.
        This must be called from the ``settings()`` function.

        The built-in variables :doc:`width` and :doc:`height` are set by the parameters
        passed to this function. For example, running ``size(640, 480)`` will assign 640
        to the :doc:`width` variable and 480 to the height ``variable``. If ``size()``
        is not used, the window will be given a default size of 100 x 100 pixels.

        The ``size()`` function can only be used once inside a Sketch, and it cannot be
        used for resizing.

        To run a Sketch at the full dimensions of a screen, use the :doc:`full_screen`
        function, rather than the older way of using ``size(display_width,
        display_height)``.

        The maximum width and height is limited by your operating system, and is usually
        the width and height of your actual screen. On some machines it may simply be
        the number of pixels on your current screen, meaning that a screen of 800 x 600
        could support ``size(1600, 300)``, since that is the same number of pixels. This
        varies widely, so you'll have to try different rendering modes and sizes until
        you get what you're looking for. If you need something larger, use
        ``create_graphics`` to create a non-visible drawing surface.

        The minimum width and height is around 100 pixels in each direction. This is the
        smallest that is supported across Windows, macOS, and Linux. We enforce the
        minimum size so that Sketches will run identically on different machines.

        The ``renderer`` parameter selects which rendering engine to use. For example,
        if you will be drawing 3D shapes, use ``P3D``. In addition to the default
        renderer, other renderers are:

        * ``P2D`` (Processing 2D): 2D graphics renderer that makes use of OpenGL-
        compatible graphics hardware.
        * ``P3D`` (Processing 3D): 3D graphics renderer that makes use of OpenGL-
        compatible graphics hardware.
        * ``FX2D`` (JavaFX 2D): A 2D renderer that uses JavaFX, which may be faster for
        some applications, but has some compatibility quirks.
        * ``PDF``: The ``PDF`` renderer draws 2D graphics directly to an Acrobat PDF
        file. This produces excellent results when you need vector shapes for high-
        resolution output or printing.
        * ``SVG``: The ``SVG`` renderer draws 2D graphics directly to an SVG file. This
        is great for importing into other vector programs or using for digital
        fabrication.

        of the sphere mesh. The default resolution is 30, which creates a fairly
        detailed sphere definition with vertices every ``360/30 = 12`` degrees. If
        you're going to render a great number of spheres per frame, it is advised to
        reduce the level of detail using this function. The setting stays active until
        ``sphere_detail()`` is called again with a new parameter and so should *not* be
        called prior to every :doc:`sphere` statement, unless you wish to render spheres
        with different settings, e.g. using less detail for smaller spheres or ones
        further away from the camera. To control the detail of the horizontal and

        eight characters; the first two characters define the alpha component, and the
        remainder define the red, green, and blue components.

        The value for the gray parameter must be less than or equal to the current
        maximum value as specified by :doc:`color_mode`. The default maximum value is
        255.

        Draws text to the screen. Displays the information specified in the first
        parameter on the screen in the position specified by the additional parameters.
        A default font will be used unless a font is set with the :doc:`text_font`
        function and a default size will be used unless a font is set with
        :doc:`text_size`. Change the color of the text with the :doc:`fill` function.
        The text displays in relation to the :doc:`text_align` function, which gives the
        option to draw to the left, right, and center of the coordinates.

        The ``x2`` and ``y2`` parameters define a rectangular area to display within and
        may only be used with string data. When these parameters are specified, they are
        interpreted based on the current :doc:`rect_mode` setting. Text that does not
        fit completely within the rectangle specified will not be drawn to the screen.

        Note that py5 lets you call ``text()`` without first specifying a Py5Font with
        :doc:`text_font`. In that case, a generic sans-serif font will be used instead.

        Draws text to the screen. Displays the information specified in the first
        parameter on the screen in the position specified by the additional parameters.
        A default font will be used unless a font is set with the :doc:`text_font`
        function and a default size will be used unless a font is set with
        :doc:`text_size`. Change the color of the text with the :doc:`fill` function.
        The text displays in relation to the :doc:`text_align` function, which gives the
        option to draw to the left, right, and center of the coordinates.

        The ``x2`` and ``y2`` parameters define a rectangular area to display within and
        may only be used with string data. When these parameters are specified, they are
        interpreted based on the current :doc:`rect_mode` setting. Text that does not
        fit completely within the rectangle specified will not be drawn to the screen.

        Note that py5 lets you call ``text()`` without first specifying a Py5Font with
        :doc:`text_font`. In that case, a generic sans-serif font will be used instead.

        When using :doc:`text` with width and height parameters, ``BASELINE`` is

        Notes
        -----

        All shapes are constructed by connecting a series of vertices. ``vertex()`` is
        used to specify the vertex coordinates for points, lines, triangles, quads, and
        polygons. It is used exclusively within the :doc:`begin_shape` and
        :doc:`end_shape` functions.

        Drawing a vertex in 3D using the ``z`` parameter requires the ``P3D`` parameter
        in combination with size, as shown in the above example.

        This function is also used to map a texture onto geometry. The :doc:`texture`
        function declares the texture to apply to the geometry and the ``u`` and ``v``
        coordinates set define the mapping of this texture to the form. By default, the
        coordinates used for ``u`` and ``v`` are specified in relation to the image's
        size in pixels, but this relation can be changed with :doc:`texture_mode`.
