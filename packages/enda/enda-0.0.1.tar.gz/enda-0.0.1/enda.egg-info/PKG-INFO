Description: # enda
        
        
        ## What is it?
        
        **enda** is a Python package that provides tools to manipulate **timeseries** data in conjunction with **contracts** data for analysis and **forecasts**. 
        
        Its main goal is to help [Rescoop.eu](https://www.rescoop.eu/) build various applications, such as short-term electricity load and production forecasts, specifically for the [RescoopVPP](https://www.rescoopvpp.eu/) project. Hence some tools in this package perform TSO (transmission network operator) and DNO (distribution network operator) data wrangling for several European countries, as well as weather data. 
        
        ## Main Features
        Here are some things **enda** does well:
        
          - Provide robust machine learning algorithms for short-term electricty load (and soon production) forecasts, developed by Enercoop and originally based on Komi Nagbe's thesis (http://www.theses.fr/s148364).
          - Manipulate **contracts** data coming from your ERP and turn it into timeseries you can use for analysis, visualisation and machine learning.  
          - Timeseries-specific detection of missing data, like time gaps and frequency changes.
          - Date-time feature engineering robust to timezone hazards.
        
        ## Where to get it
        The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/enercoop/enda
        
        Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python
        Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/enda) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
        
        ```sh
        # PyPI
