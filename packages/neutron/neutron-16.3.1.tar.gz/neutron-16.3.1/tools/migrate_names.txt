# This file provides a list of tuples that represent how the files
# in Networking-OVN repo are mapped to/from Neutron repo, as part of the blue
# print documented in:
#
# https://review.opendev.org/#/c/658414/  (specs/ussuri/ml2ovs-ovn-convergence.rst)

# Also see:

#
# Empty lines and anything after # are ignored.
# The 2 columns in this tile are added as a tuple in a list of
# files and directories to be mapped. More specific lines must be listed
# above less specific lines as the mapping stops on the first match.
