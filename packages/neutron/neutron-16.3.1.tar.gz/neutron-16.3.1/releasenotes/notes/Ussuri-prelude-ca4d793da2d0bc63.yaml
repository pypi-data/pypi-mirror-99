    The 16.0.0 release includes many bug fixes and new features.

    The most important improvements worth mentioning are:

    - Python 2 is no longer supported by Neutron, Python 3.6 and 3.7 are.

    - Address scopes and subnetpools can now be shared with other tenants using
      the Role Based Access Control (``RBAC``) mechanism.

    - Security groups can now be set as ``stateful``. Conntrack will not be
      used for any rules from such a group. This is currently supported only by
      the ``iptables`` and ``iptables_hybrid`` drivers.

    - Neutron API now allows tagging resources directly in the ``POST`` request.

    - IGMP snooping (multicast) can now be enabled in the ``OVS`` and ``OVN``
      drivers.

    - A list of IPv6 addresses for a dhcp-host entry in the dnsmasq DHCP agent
      driver can be configured. This solves problems with failing boot process
      when only one IP address is available. See `#1861032
      <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1861032>`_) for details about
      the issue.

    - The networking-ovn mechanism driver has been merged into the neutron
      repository and is now an in-tree driver for ML2.
