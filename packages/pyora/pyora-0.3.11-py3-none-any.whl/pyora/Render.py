"""
The short documentation has this to say about compositing:

Isolated groups are always rendered independently at first, starting with a fully-transparent ‘black’ backdrop
 (rgba={0,0,0,0}). The results of this independent composite are then rendered on top of the group’s own backdrop 
 using the group’s opacity and composite mode settings. Conversely non-isolated groups are rendered by rendering 
 each child layer or sub-stack in turn to the group’s backdrop, just as if there were no stacked group.

The root stack has a fixed, implicit rendering in OpenRaster: it is to composite as an isolated group over a 
background of the application’s choice.

Non-root stacks should be rendered as isolated groups if: a) their isolation property is isolate (and not auto); 
or b) their opacity is less that 1.0; or c) they use a composite-op other than svg:src-over. This inferential 
behaviour is intended to provide backwards compatibility with apps which formerly didn’t care about group isolation.

Applications may assume that all stacks are isolated groups if that is all they support. If they do so, 
they must declare when writing OpenRaster files that their layer groups are isolated (isolation='isolate').
