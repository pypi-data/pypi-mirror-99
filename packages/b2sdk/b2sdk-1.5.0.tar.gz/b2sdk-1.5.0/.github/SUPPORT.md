Issues with **B2_Command_line_tool** (problems with the tool itself) should be reported at [B2 CLI issue tracker](https://github.com/Backblaze/B2_Command_Line_Tool/issues).

Issuew with **B2 cloud service** (not caused by B2 CLI or sdk) should be reported directly to [Backblaze support](https://help.backblaze.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

Issues with the B2 python sdk should be reported in [b2-sdk-python issue tracker](https://github.com/Backblaze/b2-sdk-python/issues). This should be used by authors of tools that interact with the b2 cloud through **b2-sdk-python**, but also if an issue with some other project (that uses **b2-sdk-python**) is clearly caused by a bug in **b2-sdk-python**.
