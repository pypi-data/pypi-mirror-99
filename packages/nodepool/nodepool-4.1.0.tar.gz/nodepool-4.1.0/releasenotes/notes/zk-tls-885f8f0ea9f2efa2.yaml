    Support for encrypted connections to ZooKeeper has been added.

    Before enabling, ensure that both Zuul and Nodepool software
    versions support encrypted connections.  See the Zuul release
    notes, documentation, and associated helper scripts for more
    information.

    Both Zuul and Nodepool may need to be restarted together with the
    new configuration.
