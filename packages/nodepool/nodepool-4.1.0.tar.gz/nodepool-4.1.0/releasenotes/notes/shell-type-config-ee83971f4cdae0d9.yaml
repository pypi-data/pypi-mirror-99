    AWS EC2, GCE, Kubernetes, Openshift, Openshift Pods, OpenStack and Static
    drivers now support a shell-type config. Shell-type config is intended
    to enable setting of cmd or powershell as shell type for Windows workers
    with connection-type ssh.

    For Linux workers, there is a long standing ansible issue with using
    non-default shell type and become, so care should be taken if using
    it for such workers.
