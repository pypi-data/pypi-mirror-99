    Nodepool can now support multiple node labels, although the OpenStack and
    static node drivers do not yet support specifying multiple labels, so this
    is not yet a user-visible change. This does, however, require shutting down
    all launcher processes before restarting them. Running multiple launchers
    with mixed support of multi-label will cause errors, so a full shutdown is
    required.
