features:
  - |
    Added support for configuring windows static nodes. A static node can now
    define a ``connection-type``. The ``ssh-port`` option has been renamed
    to ``connection-port``.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``ssh-port`` in static node config is deprecated. Please update config to
    use ``connection-port`` instead.
