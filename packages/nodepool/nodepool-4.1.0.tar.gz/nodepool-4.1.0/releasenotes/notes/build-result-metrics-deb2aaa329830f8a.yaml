    Two new metrics are now reported after each run of the diskimage builder:
    nodepool.builder.dib_image_build.<diskimage_name>.<ext>.rc will be set to
    the last result code of the diskimage builder. This metric can be used to
    set up alerting for failed disk image builds.
    nodepool.builder.dib_image_build.<diskimage_name>.<ext>.duration will
    receive the time it took to build the disk image.
