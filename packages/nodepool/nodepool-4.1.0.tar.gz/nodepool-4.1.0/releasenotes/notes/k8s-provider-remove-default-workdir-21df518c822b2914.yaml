    The k8s and OpenShift providers do not longer set the workingDir attribute
    of their container specs to /tmp.

    For increased flexibility for the user, the working dir specified in the
    container images Dockerfile is used as the default in container nodes.
    Please note that this might often be the root dir ('/') if not specified
    otherwise by the respective Dockerfiles WORKDIR directive.
