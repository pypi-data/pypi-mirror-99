    Support for passing environment variables to k8s and OpenShift Pod build
    nodes has been added.

    It is not possible to set persistent env vars in containers on run time
    because there is no login shell available. Thus, we need to pass in any
    env vars during node launch. This allows to set, e.g., `http_proxy`
    variables. Environment variables can be defined on node labels as a list
    of dictionaries with `name` and `value` fields as per the k8s container
    YAML schema.
