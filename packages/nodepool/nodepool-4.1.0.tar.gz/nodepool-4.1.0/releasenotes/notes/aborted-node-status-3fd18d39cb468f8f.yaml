    A new node status (ABORTED) is added to the ZooKeeper data model. It
    is recommended that, during your nodepool upgrade, you shut down all
    launcher processes before restarting any of them. Running multiple
    launchers with mixed support of this new node status may cause
    unexpected errors to be reported in the logs.
