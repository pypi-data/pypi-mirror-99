    A new boolean pool variable ``ignore-provider-quota`` has been added to
    allow the provider quota to be ignored for a pool. Instead, nodepool only
    checks against the configured max values for the pool and the current usage
    based on stored data. This may be useful in circumstances where the
    provider is incorrectly calculating quota.
