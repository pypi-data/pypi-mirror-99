upgrade:
  - |
    The ``TaskManager`` used by the OpenStack provider has been removed.
    The ``keystoneauth1`` library underneath ``openstacksdk`` has grown
    support for rate limiting using a ``FairSemaphore`` instead of a pool
    of worker threads. This should reduce the overall thread count.
  - |
    statsd key names have changed. Because of the removal of ``TaskManager``
    statsd calls are being deferred to openstacksdk. Instead of keys of the
    form ``ComputeGetServers``, the openstacksdk keys are of the form
    ``compute.GET.servers``. They will always start with the normalized
    ``service-type``, followed by the HTTP verb, followed by a ``.`` separated
    list of url segments. Any service version, project-id entries in the url
    or ``.json`` suffixes will be removed.
