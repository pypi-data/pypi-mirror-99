    The Kubernetes driver now supports optionally loading cluster
    admin service account information from the standard in-cluster
    configuration paths if Nodepool itself is running in Kubernetes.
    If this method is used, installation of a ``kube/config`` file in
    the Nodepool launcher pod is no longer required.
