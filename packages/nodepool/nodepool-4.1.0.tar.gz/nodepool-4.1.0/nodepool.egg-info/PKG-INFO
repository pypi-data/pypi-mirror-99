Description: Nodepool
        ========
        
        Nodepool is a system for managing test node resources. It supports launching
        single-use test nodes from cloud providers as well as managing access to
        pre-defined pre-existing nodes. Nodepool is part of a suite of tools that form
        a comprehensive test system, including Zuul.

        Getting Help
        ------------
        
        There are two Zuul-related mailing lists:
        
        `zuul-announce <http://lists.zuul-ci.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zuul-announce>`_
          A low-traffic announcement-only list to which every Zuul operator or
          power-user should subscribe.
        
        `zuul-discuss <http://lists.zuul-ci.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zuul-discuss>`_
          General discussion about Zuul, including questions about how to use
          it, and future development.
        
        You will also find Zuul developers in the `#zuul` channel on Freenode
        IRC.
