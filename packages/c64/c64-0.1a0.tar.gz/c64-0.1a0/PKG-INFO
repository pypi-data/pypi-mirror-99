        Experimental package of ASGI utilities extracted from Datasette
        
        This library is an **experimental alpha**. I have not yet committed to maintaining this in the long-term, so you should not use this for any projects.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install this library using `pip`:
        
            $ pip install c64
        
        ## Usage
        
        The library provides `Request` and `Response` classes, which currently match the documented classes of the same name in Datasette, see [Datasette internals documentation](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html).
        
        ## Development
        
        To contribute to this library, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
        
            cd c64
            python -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Or if you are using `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv shell
        
        Now install the dependencies and tests:
        
            pip install -e '.[test]'
        
        To run the tests:
        
            pytest
