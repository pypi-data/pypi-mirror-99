# PyFJCore

Python wrapper of FastJet Core functionality with additional NumPy support. In contrast with the [`pyjet`](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyjet) package, PyFJCore wraps all the methods/functions in fjcore and works with regular NumPy arrays instead of structured one. In contrast with the Python extension to the main [FastJet library](http://fastjet.fr), this package can be built in a portable manner, including on Windows.

Current version of fjcore: 3.3.4

## Documentation

The FastJet [documentation](http://fastjet.fr/repo/doxygen-3.3.4/) and [manual](http://fastjet.fr/repo/fastjet-doc-3.3.4.pdf) contain helpful information for the classes and methods in PyFJCore. Not all FastJet classes are wrapped in PyFJCore, primarily just `PseudoJet`, `JetDefinition`, `ClusterSequence`, and `Selector`.

### Python User Info

A Python object can be attached to a `PseudoJet` using the `.set_python_info()` method. It can be accessed as `.python_info()`.

### NumPy conversion functions

```python
pyfjcore.ptyphim_array_to_pseudojets(ptyphims)
```

Converts a 2D array of particles, each as `(pt, y, phi, [mass])`, to PseudoJets (the mass is optional). Any additional features (columns after the initial four) of the array are set as the Python user info of the PseudoJets. This also sets the `user_index` of the PseudoJets to their position in the input array.

```python
pyfjcore.epxpypz_array_to_pseudojets(epxpypzs)
```

Converts a 2D array of particles, each as `(E, px, py, pz)`, to PseudoJets. Any additional features (columns after the initial four) of the array are set as the Python user info of the PseudoJets. This also sets the `user_index` of the PseudoJets to their position in the input array.

```python
pyfjcore.array_to_pseudojets(particles, pjrep=pyfjcore.ptyphim)
```

Converts a 2D array of particles to PseudoJets. The format of the particles kinematics is determined by the `pjrep` argument. The `PseudoJetRepresentation` enum can take the values `ptyphim`, `ptyphi`, `epxpypz`. The first two values cause this function to invoke `ptyphim_array_to_pseudojets` and the third invokes `epxpypz_array_to_pseudojets`. Any additional features (columns) of the array are set as the Python user info of the PseudoJets. This also sets the `user_index` of the PseudoJets to their position in the input array.

```python
pyfjcore.pseudojets_to_ptyphim_array(pseudojets, mass=True)
```

Converts a vector of PseudoJets to a 2D NumPy array of `(pt, y, phi, [mass])` values, where the presence of the mass is determine by the keyword argument.

```python
pyfjcore.pseudojets_to_epxpypz_array(pseudojets)
```

Converts a vector of PseudoJets to a 2D NumPy array of `(E, px, py, pz)` values.

```python
pyfjcore.pseudojets_to_array(pseudojets, pjrep=pyfjcore.ptyphim)
```

Converts a vector of PseudoJets to a 2D NumPy array of particles in the representation determined by the `pjrep` keyword argument.

```python
pyfjcore.user_indices(pseudojets)
```

Extracts the user indices from a vector of PseudoJets and returns them as a NumPy array of integers.

## Version History

### 0.3.x

**0.3.0**

- Memory leak (and subsequent crash) detected in EnergyFlow testing of PyFJCore. Removing `PseudoJetContainer` for now.

### 0.2.x

**0.2.1**

- Fixed typechecking so that PseudoJetContainer is accepted in overloaded functions such as `Selector::operator()`.

**0.2.0**

- Built against older NumPy properly; added `pyproject.toml` file.

### 0.1.x

**0.1.2**

- Renamed some `PseudoJetRepresentation` constants.
- Updated documentation.

**0.1.1**

- Fixed several bugs, including an inability to pass a `PseudoJetContainer` to the `ClusterSequence` constructor due to SWIG's typechecking.

**0.1.0**

- First version released on PyPI.

## References

PyFJCore relies critically on the fjcore [header](https://github.com/pkomiske/PyFJCore/blob/main/pyfjcore/fjcore.hh) and [source](https://github.com/pkomiske/PyFJCore/blob/main/pyfjcore/fjcore.cc) files, which in turn are created from the main FastJet library. So if you use this package in your research, please cite the [FastJet package and publications](http://fastjet.fr/about.html).

### Summary of changes to fjcore

- **fjcore.hh** 
    - Changed namespace from `fjcore` to `fastjet` to facilitate interoperability with the FastJet Python extension.
    - Wrapped some code in `IsBaseAndDerived` that SWIG cannot parse with `#ifndef SWIG_PREPROCESSOR` and `#endif`. Since SWIG doesn't need this code for anything, it parses the file correctly without affecting the actual compilation.
    - Changed templated `ClusterSequence` constructor to an untemplated version using `PseudoJet` as the former template type.

## fjcore README

```text
// fjcore -- extracted from FastJet v3.3.4 (http://fastjet.fr)
//
// fjcore constitutes a digest of the main FastJet functionality.
// The files fjcore.hh and fjcore.cc are meant to provide easy access to these 
// core functions, in the form of single files and without the need of a full 
// FastJet installation:
//
//     g++ main.cc fjcore.cc
// 
// with main.cc including fjcore.hh.
//
// A fortran interface, fjcorefortran.cc, is also provided. See the example 
// and the Makefile for instructions.
//
// The results are expected to be identical to those obtained by linking to
// the full FastJet distribution.
//
// NOTE THAT, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR FJCORE AND THE FULL FASTJET
// TO COEXIST, THE FORMER USES THE "fjcore" NAMESPACE INSTEAD OF "fastjet". 
//
// In particular, fjcore provides:
//
//   - access to all native pp and ee algorithms, kt, anti-kt, C/A.
//     For C/A, the NlnN method is available, while anti-kt and kt
//     are limited to the N^2 one (still the fastest for N < 100k particles)
//   - access to selectors, for implementing cuts and selections
//   - access to all functionalities related to pseudojets (e.g. a jet's
//     structure or user-defined information)
//
// Instead, it does NOT provide:
//
//   - jet areas functionality
//   - background estimation
//   - access to other algorithms via plugins
//   - interface to CGAL
//   - fastjet tools, e.g. filters, taggers
//
// If these functionalities are needed, the full FastJet installation must be
// used. The code will be fully compatible, with the sole replacement of the
// header files and of the fjcore namespace with the fastjet one.
//
// fjcore.hh and fjcore.cc are not meant to be human-readable.
// For documentation, see the full FastJet manual and doxygen at http://fastjet.fr
