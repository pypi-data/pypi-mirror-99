'''
Defines 'capabilities', pieces of functionality that an object needs which must
be injected. The receiver of the capability is called a :dfn:`capable`.

A given capability can be provided by more than one capability provider, but,
for a given set of providers, only one will be bound at a time. Logically, each
provider that provides the capability is asked, in a user-provided preference
order, whether it can provide the capability for the *specific* capable and the
first one which can provide the capability is bound to the object.

The core idea is dependency injection: a capability does not modify the capable:
the capable receives the provider and a reference to the capability provided,
but how the capable uses the provider is up to the capable. This is important
because the user of the capable should not condition its behavior on the
particular capability provider used, although it may change its behavior based
on which capabilities the capable has.

Note, that there may be some providers that lose their ability to provide a
capability after they have been bound to a capable. This loss should be
communicated with a `CannotProvideCapability` exception when the relevant
methods are called on the provider. This *may* allow certain operations to be
retried with a provider lower on the capability order, *but* a provider that
throws `CannotProvideCapability` may validly be asked if it can provide the
capability again -- if it *still* cannot provide the capability, it should
communicate that by returning `None` from its `provides_to` method.

Providers may keep state between calls to provide a capability but their
correctness must not depend on any ordering of method calls except that, of
course, their ``__init__`` is called first. For instance, a provider can retain
an index that it downloads to answer `provides_to`, but if that index can
expire, the provider should check for that and retrieve an updated index if
necessary.

        Returns a `Provider` if the provider provides a capability to the given object;

        The default implementation always returns `None`. Implementers of `Provider`
        should check they can actually provide the capability for the given object rather
        than just that they *might* be able to.

        It's best to do setup for providing the capability before exiting this method
        rather than, for instance, in the methods of the returned provider when the
        `Capable` is trying to use it.
