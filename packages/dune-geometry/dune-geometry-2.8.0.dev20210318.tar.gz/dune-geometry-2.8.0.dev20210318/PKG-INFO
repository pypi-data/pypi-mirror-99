Description: DUNE-library
        ============
        
        DUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox
        for solving partial differential equations with grid-based methods.
        
        The main intention is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of
        legacy and/or new libraries. Using C++ techniques DUNE allows to use very
        different implementation of the same concept (i.e. grid, solver, ...) under
        a common interface with a very low overhead.
        
        DUNE was designed with flexibility in mind. It supports easy discretization
        using methods, like Finite Elements, Finite Volume and also Finite
        Differences. Through separation of data structures DUNE allows fast Linear
        Algebra like provided in the ISTL module, or usage of external libraries
        like blas.
        
        This package contains the basic DUNE geometry classes.
