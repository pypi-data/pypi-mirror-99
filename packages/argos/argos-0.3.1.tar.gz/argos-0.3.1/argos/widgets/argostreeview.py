""" Common functionality, look and feel for all tree views in Argos.

    Currently it supports only selecting one item. That is, the current item is always the
    selected item.

    The difference between the current item and the selected item(s) is as follows:
    (from: http://doc.qt.digia.com/4.6/model-view-selection.html)

    In a view, there is always a current item and a selected item - two independent states.
    An item can be the current item and selected at the same time. The view is responsible for
    ensuring that there is always a current item as keyboard navigation, for example, requires
    a current item.

    Current Item:
        There can only be one current item.
        The current item will be changed with key navigation or mouse button clicks.
        The current item will be edited if the edit key, F2, is pressed or the item is
            double-clicked (provided that editing is enabled).
        The current item is indicated by the focus rectangle.

    Selected Items:
        There can be multiple selected items.
        The selected state of items is set or unset, depending on several pre-defined modes
            (e.g., single selection, multiple selection, etc.) when the user interacts with the
            items.
        The current item can be used together with an anchor to specify a range that should be
            selected or deselected (or a combination of the two).
        The selected items are indicated with the selection rectangle.
