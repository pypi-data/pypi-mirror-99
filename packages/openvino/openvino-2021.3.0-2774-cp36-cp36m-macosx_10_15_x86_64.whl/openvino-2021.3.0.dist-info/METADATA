## Introduction

OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and solutions that solve a variety of tasks including emulation of human vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many others. Based on latest generations of artificial neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent and attention-based networks, the toolkit extends computer vision and non-vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. It accelerates applications with high-performance, AI and deep learning inference deployed from edge to cloud.

The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for Linux\*:
- Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge
- Supports heterogeneous execution across Intel® CPU, Intel® Integrated Graphics, Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, and Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs
- Speeds time-to-market via an easy-to-use library of computer vision functions and pre-optimized kernels

**The Runtime Package Includes the Following Components Installed by Default:**

## Install the Runtime Package

### Step 1. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, use a virtual environment. Skip this
   step only if you do want to install all dependencies globally.

Create virtual environment:
```sh
python -m pip install --user virtualenv 
python -m venv openvino_env --system-site-packages
```

Activate virtual environment:<br>
On Linux and macOS:
```sh
source openvino_env/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```sh
openvino_env\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2. Set Up and Update pip to the Highest Version

Run the command below:
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 3. Install the Package

Run the command below: <br>

   ```sh
   pip install openvino
   ```

### Step 4. Verify that the Package is Installed

Run the command below:
```sh
python -c "from openvino.inference_engine import IECore"
```

You will not see any error messages if installation finished successfully.
