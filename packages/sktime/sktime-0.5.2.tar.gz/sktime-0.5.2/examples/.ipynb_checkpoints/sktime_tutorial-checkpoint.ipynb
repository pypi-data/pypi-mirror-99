    "## 1. Representing time series data\n",
    "Time series data comes in many different forms and there are many different ways to represent them. There is currently no consensus on how to best represent time series data for the purpose of modelling and evaluating machine learning workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does sktime represent time series?\n",
    " * For the purpose of machine learning with time series, the common formats of representing time series have drawbacks. Following scikit-learn and standard mathematical notation, we store time series in tables with rows representing i.i.d. instances and columns representing different variables (i.e. different kinds of measurements), but crucially, we extend the standard representation by allowing variables to not only represent primitive values (e.g. integers, floats and strings) but also entire series. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Technically, sktime uses [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) data containers, but in a slightly different way than the intended usage. Pandas data containers are designed to store primitive data types in their cells, e.g. integers, floats or strings.However, pandas cells can store arbitrary types. Inspired by [xpandas](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/xpandas), we make use of this and store not just primitive types, but entire series in cells. This gives us a very flexible representation of time series data. It enables us to represent time heterogenous series, i.e. series which do not share a common time index across instances and/or variables. At the same time, we can still make use of most of pandas' functionality and familiar interface. Nevertheless, there are a number of disadvantages, which we try to address in future work. Much of the disucssion around the data representation is still ongoing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional resources\n",
    "* For more details on representing time series data, see our [wiki entry](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Data-representation-in-sktime), our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07872.pdf), and this [document](https://github.com/MaxBenChrist/awesome_time_series_in_python/blob/master/standardize_time_series_formats.md) by one of the [tsfresh](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh) developers\n",
    "* For a list of available alternative data containers we considered, please see our [wiki entry on related software](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/Related-software#time-series-data-containers)\n",
    "* For the ongoing discussion about data representation in sktime, see [issue #15](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/15) on GitHub\n",
    "* For more code examples for loading data into the format assumed by sktime, see this [example notebook](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/main/examples/loading_data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example dataset\n",
    "Here we load an example classification dataset from the literature, called GunPoint, and inspect the returned pandas data container. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The GunPoint problem contains univariate tracking data of actor's wrists as they either take a prop gun from a holster, point it, and return it to the holster, or they simply mime the action without the prop. The classification problem is to detect whether a motion trace is a case of _gun_ or _no gun_. The most discriminatory part of the time series shown above offers an interpretable result into how classification decisions can be made; the highlighted red section of the series above is where an actor returns the gun to the holster. As explained in [1], this is discriminatory because if the gun prop is present then the actor's hand stops suddenly, but if the prop is not present, the actor's hand will not stop abruptly and will subtly continue past their waist due to inertia. \n",
