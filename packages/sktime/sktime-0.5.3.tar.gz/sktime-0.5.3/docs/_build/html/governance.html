<p>sktime is a consensus-based community project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project, and participate in the governance process. This document describes how that participation takes place, which roles we have in our community, how we make decisions, and how we acknowledge contributions.</p>
<p>We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious contributors, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.

<p>Algorithm maintainers are contributors who have contributed an
algorithm. They have the same voting rights as core developers with
regard to their algorithm.</p>
<p>In sktime, algorithms are encapsulated in classes with specific
interface requirements and are called estimators. To faciliate
maintainership questions, we try to write algorithms in separate files
when possible.</p>

<span id="id15"></span><h2>Decision making<a class="headerlink" href="#decision-making" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is to formalize the decision-making process
used by the sktime project. We clarify:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what types of changes we make decision on,</p></li>
<li><p>how decisions are made, and</p></li>
<li><p>who participates in the decision making.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>sktime’s decision-making process is designed to take into account
feedback from all community members and strives to find consensus, while
avoiding deadlocks when no consensus can be found.</p>
<p>All discussion and votes takes place on the project’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues">issue
tracker</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/pulls">pull requests</a> or an <a class="reference internal" href="#steps"><span class="std std-ref">sktime enhancement proposal</span></a>. Some
sensitive discussions and appointment votes occur on private chats.</p>
<p>The CC reserves the right to overrule decisions.</p>
<p>We distinguish between the following types of proposed changes. The
corresponding decision making process is described in more detail below.</p>

<div class="section" id="stage-1-lazy-consensus-with-veto-right">
<span id="stage-1"></span><h3>Stage 1: lazy consensus with veto right<a class="headerlink" href="#stage-1-lazy-consensus-with-veto-right" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>sktime uses a “consensus seeking” process for making decisions. The
community tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among
core developers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To accept proposed changes, we require approval by one core developer
(lazy consensus) and no rejection by a core developer (veto right).</p></li>
<li><p>Approvals and rejections can be expressed as +1 and -1 comments,
respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Core developers are expected to give reasonable time to others to
give their opinion on the pull request if they’re not confident
others would agree.</p></li>
<li><p>More important changes that impact the full project require a more
detailed analysis and a consensus that is both explicit and informed.
These changes require an <a class="reference internal" href="#steps"><span class="std std-ref">sktime enhancement proposal</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When no consensus can be found, the decision is escaled to <a class="reference internal" href="#stage-2"><span class="std std-ref">Stage 2: voting</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stage-2-voting">
<span id="stage-2"></span><h3>Stage 2: voting<a class="headerlink" href="#stage-2-voting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When no consensus can be found, any core developer can call for a vote
at any point during the discussion.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The vote will conclude 5 days excluding weekends from the call for the vote.</p></li>
<li><p>Votes are voluntary. Abstentions are allowed. You can
abstain by simply not casting a vote.</p></li>
<li><p>All votes are a binary vote: for or against accepting the proposed
changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Votes are casts as comments: +1 (approval) or -1 (rejection).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For all types of changes, except appointments, votes take place on the
related public issue or pull request. The winning condition is a 2/3
majority of the votes casts by core developers including CC members. If the
proposed change cannot gather a 2/3 majority of the votes cast by core
developers, the decision is escalated to the <a class="reference internal" href="#stage-3"><span class="std std-ref">Stage 3: conflict resolution</span></a>.</p>
<p>For appointments, votes take place in private communication channels
and are anonymous. The winning conditions vary depending on the role as
described in <a class="reference internal" href="#roles"><span class="std std-ref">Roles</span></a> above. Appointment decisions are not escalated to
the CC. If a nomination cannot gather sufficient support, the nomination is
rejected.</p>

<span id="stage-3"></span><h3>Stage 3: conflict resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#stage-3-conflict-resolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the proposed change cannot gather a 2/3 majority of the votes cast,
the CC tries to resolve the deadlock.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The CC will use consensus seeking.</p></li>
<li><p>If no consensus can be found within a month, the decision is made
through a simple majority vote (with tie breaking) among the CC
members.</p></li>
<li><p>Any CC decision must be supported by an <a class="reference internal" href="#steps"><span class="std std-ref">sktime enhancement proposal</span></a>, which has been made public and discussed before the vote.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="sktime-enhancement-proposal">
<span id="steps"></span><h3>sktime enhancement proposal<a class="headerlink" href="#sktime-enhancement-proposal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For all decision of the CC, an sktime enhancement proposal (STEP) must have been made
public and discussed before the vote.</p>
<p>An sktime enhancement proposal is a consolidated document, with a concise
problem statement, a clear description of the proposed solution and a
comparison with alternative solutions, as outlined in our
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/blob/master/TEMPLATE.md">template</a>.</p>
<p>We collect and discuss proposals in sktime’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals">repository for
enhancement-proposals</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="algorithm-inclusion-guidelines">
<span id="id16"></span><h3>Algorithm inclusion guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm-inclusion-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Curation is about how we select contributions, which criteria we use in
order to decide which contributions to include, and in which cases we
deprecate and remove contributions.</p>
<p>We have the following guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We only consider published algorithms which have been shown to be
competitive in comparative benchmarking studies or practically useful
in applied projects. A technique that provides a clear-cut
improvement (e.g. an enhanced data structure or a more efficient
approximation technique) on a widely-used method will also be
considered for inclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>From the algorithms or techniques that meet the above criteria, only
those which fit well within the current API of sktime are accepted.
For algorithms that do not fit well into the current API, the API
will have to be extended first. For extending current API, see the
<a class="reference external" href="#Decision-making">decision making process</a> for major changes.</p></li>
<li><p>The contributor should support the importance of the proposed
addition with research papers and/or implementations in other similar
packages, demonstrate its usefulness via common
use-cases/applications and corroborate performance improvements, if
any, with benchmarks and/or plots. It is expected that the proposed
algorithm should outperform the methods that are already implemented
in sktime in at least some areas.</p></li>
<li><p>We strive to consolidate existing functionality if helps to improve
the usability and maintainability of the project. For example, when
there are multiple techniques for the same purpose, we prefer to
combine them into a single class and make case distinctions based on
hyper-parameters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that your implementation need not be in sktime to be used together
with sktime tools. You can implement your favorite algorithm in a sktime
compatible way in one of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sktime">our companion
repositories</a> on GitHub. We will be happy
to list it under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/wiki/related-software">related
software</a>.</p>
<p>If algorithms require major dependencies, we encourage to create a
separate companion repository. For example, for deep learning techniques
based on TensorFlow and Keras, we have
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sktime/sktime-dl">sktime-dl</a>. For smaller
dependencies which are limited to a few files, we encourage to use soft
dependencies, which are only required for particular modules, but not
for most of sktime’s functionality and not for installing sktime.</p>

<div class="section" id="outlook">
<span id="id18"></span><h2>Outlook<a class="headerlink" href="#outlook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We are open to improvement suggestions for our governance model. Once
the community grows more and sktime’s code base becomes more
consolidated, we will consider the following changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Allow for more time to discuss changes, and more time to cast vote
when no consensus can be found,</p></li>
<li><p>Require more positive votes (less lazy consensus) to accept changes
during consensus seeking stage,</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce time for maintainers to reply to issues</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we plan to add more roles for managing/coordinating
specific project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Community manager (mentorship, outreach, social media, etc),</p></li>
<li><p>Sub-councils for project-specific technical leadership (e.g.  for documentation, learning tasks, continuous integration)</p></li>
</ul>
