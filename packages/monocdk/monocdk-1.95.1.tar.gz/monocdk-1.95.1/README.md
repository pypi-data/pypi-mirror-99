# monocdk Experiment

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

An **experiment** to bundle all of the CDK into a single module.

> :warning: Please don't use this module unless you are interested in providing
> feedback about this experience.

## Usage

### Installation

To try out `monocdk` replace all references to CDK Construct
Libraries (most `@aws-cdk/*` packages) in your `package.json` file with a single
entrey referring to `monocdk`.

You also need to add a reference to the `constructs` library, according to the
kind of project you are developing:

* For libraries, model the dependency under `devDependencies` **and** `peerDependencies`
* For apps, model the dependency under `dependencies` only

### Use in your code

#### Classic import

You can use a classic import to get access to each service namespaces:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from monocdk import core, aws_s3 as s3


app = core.App()
stack = core.Stack(app, "MonoCDK-Stack")

s3.Bucket(stack, "TestBucket")
```

#### Barrel import

Alternatively, you can use "barrel" imports:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from monocdk import App, Stack
from monocdk.aws_s3 import Bucket


app = App()
stack = Stack(app, "MonoCDK-Stack")

Bucket(stack, "TestBucket")
```
