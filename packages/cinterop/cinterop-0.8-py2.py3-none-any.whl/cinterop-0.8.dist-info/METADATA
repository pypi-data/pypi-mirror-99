### Ancestry, acknowledgements

This python package `cinterop` relates loosely to prior work for interoperability between C++, R and .NET ([R.NET](https://github.com/rdotnet/rdotnet))

`cinterop` features using `cffi` were also significantly informed by Kevin Plastow's [work](https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=823898220073899;res=IELENG) while he was at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology; this contribution is gratefully acknowledged.

In you have native interop needs you may also want to look at:

* the nuget package [dynamic-interop-dll](https://github.com/rdotnet/dynamic-interop-dll) for .NET/native interop.
* Reference counting package [refcount](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/pyrefcount)
* a C# library for [generating interop glue code on top of C API glue code](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/c-api-wrapper-generation).
