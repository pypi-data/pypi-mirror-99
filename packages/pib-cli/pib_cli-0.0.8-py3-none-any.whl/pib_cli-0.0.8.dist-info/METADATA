# PIB CLI

A development environment CLI, complete with tooling.

[Project Documentation](https://pib_cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Develop Branch

[![pib_cli-automation](https://github.com/shared-vision-solutions/pib_cli/workflows/pib_cli%20Automation/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/shared-vision-solutions/pib_cli/actions)

## Master Branch

[![pib_cli-automation](https://github.com/shared-vision-solutions/pib_cli/workflows/pib_cli%20Automation/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/shared-vision-solutions/pib_cli/actions)

## Installation

This is a development environment CLI, with a customizable yaml config.

It's built into this [Cookie Cutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template:

- [Python In A Box](https://github.com/shared-vision-solutions/python-in-a-box)

To install, simply use: `pip install pib_cli`

## Usage

- use the `dev` command for details once inside the container

## Container

[python:3.7-slim](https://github.com/docker-library/python/tree/master/3.7/buster/slim)

## License

[MPL-2](LICENSE)

## Customizing the Command Line Interface

The CLI has some defaults built in, but is customizable by setting the `PIB_CONFIG_FILE_LOCATION` environment variable.
The default config file can be found [here](pib_cli/config/config.yml).

Each command is described by a yaml key in this format :

```yaml
- name: "command-name"
  path_method: "location_string"
  commands:
    - "one or more"
    - "shell commands"
    - "each run in a discrete environment"
  success: "Success Message"
  failure: "Failure Message"
```

where `location_string` is one of:

- `project_root` (`/app`)
- `project_docs` (`/app/documentation`)
- `project_home` (`/app/${PROJECT_HOME}`)

## Installing a virtual environment, and the CLI on your host machine

The [scripts/extras.sh](scripts/extras.sh) script does this for you.

First install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) on your host machine:
- `pip install poetry`

Then source this script, setup the extras, and you can use the `dev` command on your host:
- `source scripts/extras.sh`
- `pib_setup_hostmachine` (to install the poetry dependencies)  
- `dev --help` (to run the cli outside the container)

This is most useful for making an IDE like pycharm aware of what's installed in your project.

> It is still recommended to work inside the container, as you'll have access to the full managed python environment, 
> as well as any additional services you are running in containers.  

If you wish to use the cli outside the container for all tasks, [tomll](https://github.com/pelletier/go-toml) and [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) will also need to be installed, or the [cli.yml](./assets/cli.yml) configuration will need to be customized to remove these commands. (Not recommended.)

## Development Dependencies

You'll need to install:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup the Development Environment

Build the development environment container (this takes a few minutes):

- `docker-compose build`

Start the environment container:

- `docker-compose up -d`

Spawn a shell inside the container:

- `./container`
