BIDScoin is a user friendly `open-source <https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin>`__ python toolkit that converts ("coins") source-level (raw) neuroimaging data-sets to `nifti <https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/>`__ / `json <https://www.json.org/>`__ / `tsv <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values>`__ data-sets that are organized following the Brain Imaging Data Structure, a.k.a. the `BIDS <http://bids.neuroimaging.io>`__ standard. Rather then depending on complex or ambiguous programmatic logic for the identification of imaging modalities, BIDScoin uses a mapping approach to identify and convert the raw source data into BIDS data. Different runs of source data are identified by reading information from MRI header files (DICOM or PAR/REC; e.g. ``ProtocolName``) and the mapping information about how these runs should be converted to BIDS can be specified a priori as well as interactively by the researcher -- bringing in the missing knowledge that often exists only in his or her head!

Because all the mapping information can be easily edited with the `Graphical User Interface (GUI) <screenshots.html>`__, BIDScoin requires no programming knowledge in order to use it.

BIDScoin is developed at the `Donders Institute <https://www.ru.nl/donders/>`__ of the `Radboud University <https://www.ru.nl/english/>`__.

::

   Are you a python programmer with an interest in BIDS who knows all about GE and / or Philips data?
   Are you experienced with parsing stimulus presentation log-files? Or do you have ideas to improve
   the this toolkit or its documentation? Have you come across bugs? Then you are highly encouraged to
   provide feedback or contribute to this project on https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin.
