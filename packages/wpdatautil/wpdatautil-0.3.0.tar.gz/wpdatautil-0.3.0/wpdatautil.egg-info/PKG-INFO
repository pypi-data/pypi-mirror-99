Description: # wpdatautil
        **wpdatautil** is a Python 3.8 package with specific reusable utility functions for data processing.
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install -U wpdatautil` will install the package but intentionally not any third-party requirements.
        Given that the third-party package requirements can be numerous, and not all of them are relevant to most users, they can be installed as needed by a user.
        
        ## Usage
        The implemented utilities are broadly organized by their primary third-party or builtin package requirement.
        For example, `.pandas` contains utilities which primarily require the `pandas` package.
        Similarly, `.boto3.s3path` contains utilities which require both the `boto3` and `s3path` packages.
