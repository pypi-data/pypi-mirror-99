Description: # Wrestling
        
        This project is for generating and tracking wrestling statistics.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Docs
        Documentation live on ReadTheDocs [here](https://wrestling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/wrestling.html#module-wrestling)
        
        ### Installing
        
        In order to install this project you must have a working installation of python and the pip package manager.
        
        Install via CLI
        
        ```
        pip install wrestling
        ```
        
        End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        I chose to use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.2.1/#).
        
        Tests cover most of the functionality not covered by validators from the attrs library in addition to testing the validators themselves.
        
        All tests w/ coverage:
        ```
        coverage run -m pytest
        ```
        
        Then to see report:
        ```
        coverage html
        ```
        and open htmlcov/index.html
