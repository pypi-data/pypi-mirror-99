    Added image filtering for magnum. When open a image selector for cluster
    creation dialog, many invalid images were shown. If a project has a lot
    of images, options can be quite long, and cause wrong selection by mistake.
    Now, images that has "os_distro" property and its value is one of
    "fedora-atomic", "coreos" and "ubuntu" would be shown.

    Magnum only allows the node count in cluster update now.
    Properties for cluster update filtered in favor of Magnum API.

    Supported api-version for client. Magnum API is using micro versions
    and to get the correct fuctions support, user or client have to
    initialize the correct client with parameter 'api_version'.
    Magnum UI also follow the same way as other OpenStack services
    to read the version from OPENSTACK_API_VERSIONS of Horizon
    local_settings.py.
