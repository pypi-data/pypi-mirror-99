    [`blueprint add-quotas-panel <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/magnum-ui/+spec/add-quotas-panel>`_]
    Added quotas panel for admin. This panel has CRUD operations for quotas.
    For now, admin user can limit only the number of clusters for each project.
    To enable quotas panel, copy
    `magnum_ui/enabled/_2370_admin_container_infra_panel_group.py` and
    `magnum_ui/enabled/_2371_admin_container_infra_quotas_panel.py` into
    horizon's `enabled` directory.
