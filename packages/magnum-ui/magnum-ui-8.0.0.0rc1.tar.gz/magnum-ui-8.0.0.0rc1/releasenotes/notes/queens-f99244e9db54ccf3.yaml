    [`bug/1638863 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/magnum/+bug/1638863>`_]
    Magnum has issue for updating labels of cluster template and cluster.
  - >
    Removed link to Stack. Panel for Stack, i.e. Heat Dashboard,
    was separated to independent UI Plugin.
    So we removed link to Stack panel on details view for Cluster.
    We might restore the link if we can find the installed plugins
    and paths to link.

    [`bug/1742599 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/magnum-ui/+bug/1742599>`_]
    Fixed issue the deleted item is selected again with batch delete.
    Items recently deleted with batch action had been shown in deletion
    confirmation dialog when execute the batch delete action again.
    And this had caused the conflict error due to trying to delete
    unexisting item.
