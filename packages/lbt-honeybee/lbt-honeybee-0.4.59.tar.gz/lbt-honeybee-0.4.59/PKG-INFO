        # lbt-honeybee
        
        Collection of all Honeybee core Python libraries.
        
        Note that this repository and corresponding Python package does not contain any
        code and it simply exists to provide a shortcut for installing all of the honeybee
        core libraries together.
        
        ## Included Honeybee Extensions
        
        Running `pip install lbt-honeybee` will result in the installation of the following
        honeybee Python packages:
        
        * [honeybee-radiance](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance)
        * [honeybee-radiance-folder](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance-folder)
        * [honeybee-radiance-command](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance-command)
        * [honeybee-energy](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy)
        * [honeybee-energy-standards](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-energy-standards)
        
        ## Included Honeybee Core Libraries
        
        Since both honeybee extensions use the honeybee core libraries, the following
        dependencies are also included:
        
        * [honeybee-core](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-core)
        * [honeybee-schema](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-schema)
        
        ## All Ladybug Packages Are Also Included
        
        Since honeybee uses ladybug, the following is also included:
        
        * [lbt-ladybug](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/lbt-ladybug)
