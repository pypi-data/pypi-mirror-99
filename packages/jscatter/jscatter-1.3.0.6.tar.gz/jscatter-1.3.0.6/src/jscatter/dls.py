    Inverse Laplace transform known as CONTIN analysis developed by Steven Provencher [1,2]_ .
    
    This is a wrapper for the original FORTRAN program from Steven Provencher.
    The CONTIN analysis is developed for heterodisperse, polydisperse, and multimodal systems that cannot
    be resolved with the cumulant method. The resolution for separating two different particle 
    populations is approximately a factor of five or higher and the difference in relative 
    intensities between two different populations should be less than 1:10−5. (from Wikipedia and own experience).
    Iuser[i] and Rxx are defined in the original Fortran code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    datalist : dataList or single dataArray
        Correlation data as measured e.g. by DLS.
        Check type parameter dependent on input data g1 or g2!
        Each dataArray is processed.
    timescale : float, default 1e-6
        Timescale factor. CONTIN uses internal units of seconds.
        As typical instruments use microseconds the time axis needs to be scaled by this factor.
    tmin,tmax : float,int
        First/last time value to use in fit.
        If tmin/tmax are negative the number of points are dropped at begin/end of input data.
        e.g. min=-5 drops the 5 shortest time points; for max the 5 last points
    Ngrid : int
        Number of grid points between gmin and gmax.
    gmin/gmax : float
        First/last time value in distribution X scale.
        If not given calculated from tmin/tmax according to used kernel.
    qgmin/qgmax : float
        Only for 'relax'.  Same as gmin,gmax except that gmin=qgmin/q^2.
    qtmin/qtmax : float
        q^2*t scaled times.
    bgr : float; default 0
        If >0: assume background and fit it.
    typ :  int;  default 0
         - 0:  input is g1 (field correlation)
         - 1:  input is intensity correlation g2 as measured by DLS; g1= sign(g2/R21-1)*abs(g2/R21-1)^0.5
         - -1: input is g2-1, takes only the square root; sign preserved as for 1.
               ALV and Malvern Zetasizer save g2-1
    distribution : string, default='x' for DLS,
        Selects distribution type (Iuser(10)) as {'m':1,'D':2,'L':2,'r':3,'u':4,'x':4,'d':4,'T':4}

            -   for nmr rotational diffusion T1 with R23=-1 R21=1, R22=-1 neglecting T2
            -   intensity ~ number of contributing atoms ~M ~ V ~ Rh**3
            -   rot correlation time tc=(4pi*visc/kT)*Rh**3 -> intensity(0) ~ tc -> R23=1

        If 1 use Rayleigh Debye Gans formfactor with wall thickness WALL [cm] of hollow sphere (default WALL =0)

    l : float , R16 overrides value in dataArray if given
        Overrides wavelength in data and set it to 632 nm

    If Peaks seem small please integrate them as the peak area determines the contributed intensity.
    Peak area is strongly dependent on the peak point separation P(i)*(x[i]-x[i-1]) in particular on a log scale.
    See [4]_ for details.

     p1=(10<ff.X) &(ff.X<100) # peak borders 10 and 100
     fp1=np.trapz(ff.Y[p1],ff.X[p1])/np.trapz(ff.Y,ff.X) # fraction of full signal

    **An example dataset with noise**
    In this synthetic example the noise causes a peak width of about 20% (std/mean) as it is
    typically found for monodisperse samples (e.g. proteins).
    This contribution is not caused by polydispersity and always present dependent on noise level.

    D = 0.05 nm²/ns corresponds to a hydrodynamic radius of 4.3 nm and results in a
    relaxation time :math:`\Gamma= q^2D \approx 90.2 µs`.

    The below plot shows the CONTIN result as correlation time distribution
    with mean 92 µs ±17 µs and peak weight 95% in good approximation.

def readZetasizerNano(filename, NANOcoding="cp1257", NANOlocale=None):
    """
    Read ascii file data exported from Malvern Zetasizer Nano.

    Format of Zetasizer is one measurement per line with content defined in export macro.
    First line gives names of columns as header line, so header line in NANO export is necessary.
    Lists as Sizes, Volumes... need to be separated by "sample name" because of different length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : string
        Zetasizer filename
    NANOcoding : string
        UTF coding from Windows
    NANOlocale : list of string
        | encoding of weekday names in NAno textfile
        | ['de_DE','UTF-8'] NANO set to German
        | ['en_US','UTF-8'] NANO set to US
        | ...

    Returns
    -------
    dataList with dataArray for each measurement
     Dataarray contains :
       - correlation data [CorrelationDelayTime; g2minus1; g1] (if present otherwise empty dataArray)
       - .distributions : Distribution fits with columns
          [RelaxationTimes, Sizes, Intensities, Volumes, Diffusions] (if present)
       - fit results of correlation function in attributes (some channels are discarded -> see Zetasizer settings)
           - .distributionFitDelayTimes timechanels
           - .distributionFitData measured points
           - .distributionFit fit result
       - Check .attr for more attributes like
         SampleName, MeanCountRate, SizePeak1mean, SizePeak1width, Temperature

        If no correlation or distributions are present the data are zero and only parameters are stored.
        No unit conversion is done.

    CorrelationData.Y contains 1-g2=g1**2 with 0 for negative 1-g2.

    Notes
    -----
    The template for export in Zetasizer has some requirements:

    - The header line should be included.
    - Separator is the tab.
    - First entries should be "Serial Number" "Type" "Sample Name" "Measurement Date and Time"
    - Sequence data as "Sizes", "Intensities" should be separated by "Sample Name" as separator.
    - Appending to same file is allowed if new header line is included.
