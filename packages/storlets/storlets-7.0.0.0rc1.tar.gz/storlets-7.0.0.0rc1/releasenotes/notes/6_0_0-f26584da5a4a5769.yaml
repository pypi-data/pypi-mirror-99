    In this cycle, Storlets includes some fixes to improve its stability.

features:
  - |
    Now Storlets supports Python 3.8 to run server side modules like middleware
    and gateway, as well as agent processes in containers.

other:
  - |
    In this cycle Storlets still supports Python 2.7 because OpenStack Swift
    still supports Python 2.7 as its runtime. This support will be droppend
    once Swift drops its Python 2.7 support.
