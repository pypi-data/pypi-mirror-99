features:
  - |
    Storlets now experimentally supports Python3 environment for user-code
    execution. With this stuff, Storlets supports the new API
    `X-Object-Meta-Storlet-Language-Version` that can be set by user with
    a value like `3.5`.
issues:
  - |
    The new Python3 execution has several restriction with minor versions
    so it should be improved in the next release cycle.
upgrade:
  - |
    To enable the new Python3 environment for Storlets users, administrator
    must re-create the execution container image to include the py3 runtime
    inside the container. This upgrade can work without downtime,
    what administrators should do to upgrade is to push the image to their
    own container registry.
fixes:
  - Other various minor bug fixes.
