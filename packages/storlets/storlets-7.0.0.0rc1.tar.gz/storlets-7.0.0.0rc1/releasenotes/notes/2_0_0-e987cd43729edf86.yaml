    Secure container isolation for Storlets environment is still an ongoing
    work. Storlets enables user-defined code to run on the OpenStack Swift
    node with Docker container isolation level but a malicious user would run
    any attacking code there using recent vulnerability. Using more secure
    container like kata may mitigate such a risk of vulnerability.
  - Support user function written by py3 (current runner only supports
    python2 env)
Upgrades:
  - |
    Refactor sbus listing server that is used on conversation between Storlets
    daemon and Storlets middleware. The refactor decrease the number of lines
    for common process communications.
fixes:
  - Fix all python Storlets daemon processes as py3 compatible.
  - Switch test runner from testr to stestr
  - Other various minor bug fixes
