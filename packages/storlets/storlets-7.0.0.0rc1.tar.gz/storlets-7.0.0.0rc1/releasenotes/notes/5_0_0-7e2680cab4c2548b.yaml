prelude: >
    Now Storlets is fully compatible with Python 3.6, while it keeps support
    for Python 2.7.
features:
  - |
    Operatos can run Storlets engine and Storlets python applications on
    Python 3 (3.6).
upgrade:
  - |
    Now python storlet applications are executed in Python 3 instead of Python
    2 by default. To run python storlet applications on Python 2, users should
    explicitly specify language version by adding
    ``X-Object-Meta-Storlet-Language-Version`` to application objects.
deprecation:
  - |
    Python 2.7 is still supported in this release, but will be removed in
    V-release, once Swift drops Python 2.7 support.
