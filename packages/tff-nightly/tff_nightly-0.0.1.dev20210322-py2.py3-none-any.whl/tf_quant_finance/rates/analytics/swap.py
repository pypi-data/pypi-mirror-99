    equity_leg_notional: A `Tensor` of the same `dtype` as
      `equity_leg_forward_prices` and of compatible shape.  Notional amount for
      each cashflow.
    rate_leg_daycount_fractions: A `Tensor` of the same `dtype` as
      `rate_leg_coupon_rates` and of compatible shape.  Year fractions for the
      coupon accrual.
    rate_leg_discount_factors: A `Tensor` of the same `dtype` as
      `rate_leg_coupon_rates` and of compatible shape. Discount factors for each
      cashflow of the rate leg.
    equity_leg_discount_factors: A `Tensor` of the same `dtype` as
      `equity_leg_forward_prices` and of compatible shape. Discount factors for
      each cashflow of the equity leg.
    equity_dividends: A `Tensor` of the same `dtype` as
      `equity_leg_forward_prices` and of compatible shape. Dividends paid at the
      leg reset times.
      Default value: None which maps to zero dividend.
    is_equity_receiver: A boolean `Tensor` of shape compatible with
      `batch_shape`. Indicates whether the swap holder is equity holder or
      receiver.
      Default value: None which means that all swaps are equity reiver swaps.
    dtype: `tf.Dtype`. If supplied the dtype for the input and ouput `Tensor`s.
      Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred from
      `rate_leg_coupon_rates`.
    name: Python str. The name to give to the ops created by this function.
      Default value: None which maps to 'equity_swap_price'.

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of the same `dtype` as `rate_leg_coupon_rates` and of shape
    `batch_shape`. Present values of the equity swaps.
