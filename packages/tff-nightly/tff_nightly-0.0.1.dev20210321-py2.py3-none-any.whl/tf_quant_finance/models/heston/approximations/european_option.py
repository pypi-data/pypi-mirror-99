  """Calculates European option prices under the Heston model.

  Heston originally published in 1993 his eponymous model [3]. He provided
  a semi- analytical formula for pricing European option via Fourier transform
  under his model. However, as noted by Albrecher [1], the characteristic
  function used in Heston paper can suffer numerical issues because of the
  discontinuous nature of the square root function in the complex plane, and a
  second version of the characteric function which doesn't suffer this
  shortcoming should be used instead. Attari [2] further refined the numerical
  method by reducing the number of numerical integrations (only one Fourier
  transform instead of two) and with an integrand function decaying
  quadratically instead of linearly. Attari's numerical method is implemented
  here.

  Heston model:
  ```
    dF/F = sqrt(V) * dW_1
    dV = kappa * (theta - V) * dt * sigma * sqrt(V) * dW_2
    <dW_1,dW_2> = rho *dt
  ```
  The variance V follows a square root process.

  #### Example
  ```python
  import tf_quant_finance as tff
  import numpy as np
  prices = tff.models.heston.approximations.european_option_price(
      variances=0.11,
      strikes=102.0,
      expiries=1.2,
      forwards=100.0,
      is_call_options=True,
      kappas=2.0,
      thetas=0.5,
      sigmas=0.15,
      rhos=0.3,
      discount_factors=1.0,
      dtype=np.float64)
  # Expected print output of prices:
  # 24.82219619

  Args:
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The strikes of the options
      to be priced.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `strikes`.  The expiry of each option.
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with
      `strikes`. Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put
      (if False). If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    variances: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `strikes`. The initial value of the variance.
    kappas: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `strikes`. The mean reversion strength of the variance square root
      process.
    thetas: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `strikes`. The mean reversion level of the variance square root process.
    sigmas: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `strikes`. The volatility of the variance square root process (volatility
      of volatility)
    rhos: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `strikes`. The correlation between spot and variance.
        spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of the
      `volatilities`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `strikes`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the
      `spots` must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    discount_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `strikes` and of the shape that broadcasts with `strikes`.
      If not `None`, discount factors are calculated as e^(-rT),
      where r are the discount rates, or risk free rates. At most one of
      discount_rates and discount_factors can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to r = 0 and discount factors = 1 when
      discount_factors also not given.
    continuous_dividends: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `strikes` and of the shape that broadcasts with `strikes`.
      If not `None`, `cost_of_carries` is calculated as r - q,
      where r are the `discount_rates` and q is `continuous_dividends`. Either
      this or `cost_of_carries` can be given.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to q = 0.
    cost_of_carries: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `strikes` and of the shape that broadcasts with `strikes`.
      Cost of storing a physical commodity, the cost of interest paid when
      long, or the opportunity cost, or the cost of paying dividends when short.
      If not `None`, and `spots` is supplied, used to calculate forwards from
      `spots`: F = e^(bT) * S, where F is the forwards price, b is the cost of
      carries, T is expiries and S is the spot price. If `None`, value assumed
      to be equal to the `discount_rate` - `continuous_dividends`
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to b = r.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `strikes`. If not `None`, these are the discount factors to expiry
      (i.e. e^(-rT)). Mutually exclusive with discount_rate and cost_of_carry.
      If neither is given, no discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted
      option price is returned). If `spots` is supplied and `discount_factors`
      is not `None` then this is also used to compute the forwards to expiry.
      At most one of discount_rates and discount_factors can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, which maps to -log(discount_factors) / expiries
    integration_method: An instance of `math.integration.IntegrationMethod`.
      Default value: `None` which maps to the Simpsons integration rule.
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred by
      TensorFlow.
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: None which is mapped to the default name
      `heston_price`.
    **kwargs: Additional parameters for the underlying integration method.
      If not supplied and `integration_method` is Simpson, then uses
      `IntegrationMethod.COMPOSITE_SIMPSONS_RULE` with `num_points=1001`, and
      bounds `lower=1e-9`, `upper=100`.
  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of the same shape as the input data which is the price of
    European options under the Heston model.
