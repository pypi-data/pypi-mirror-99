  Args:
    volatilities: Real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The volatilities to
      expiry of the options to price.
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The strikes of the options to be priced.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The expiry of each option. The units should be such that
      `expiry * volatility**2` is dimensionless.
    spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of the
      `volatilities`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `volatilities`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the
      `spots` must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    discount_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not `None`, discount factors are calculated as e^(-rT),
      where r are the discount rates, or risk free rates.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to r = 0 and discount factors = 1 when
      discount_factors also not given.
    continuous_dividends: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. The continuous dividend rate on the underliers. May be
      negative (to indicate costs of holding the underlier).
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to zero dividends.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not `None`, these are the discount factors to expiry
      (i.e. e^(-rT)). Mutually exclusive with discount_rate.
      If neither is given, no discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted
      option price is returned). If `spots` is supplied and `discount_factors`
      is not `None` then this is also used to compute the forwards to expiry.
      At most one of discount_rates and discount_factors can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, which maps to -log(discount_factors) / expiries
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with
      `volatilities`. Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put
      (if False). If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    max_iterations: positive `int`. The maximum number of iterations of Newton's
      root finding method to find the critical spot price above and below which
      the pricing formula is different.
      Default value: 100
    tolerance: Positive scalar `Tensor`. As with max_iterations, used with the
      Newton root finder to find the critical spot price. The root finder will
      judge an element to have converged if `|f(x_n) - a|` is less than
      `tolerance` (where `f` is the target function as defined in [1] and
      `x_n` is the estimated critical value), or if `x_n` becomes `nan`. When an
      element is judged to have converged it will no longer be updated. If all
      elements converge before `max_iterations` is reached then the root finder
      will return early.
      Default value: 1e-8
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred by
       TensorFlow.
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: None which is mapped to the default name `adesi_whaley`.

  Returns:
    A 3-tuple containing the following items in order:
       (a) option_prices: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `forwards`. The Black
         Scholes price of the options.
       (b) converged: A boolean `Tensor` of the same shape as `option_prices`
         above. Indicates whether the corresponding adesi-whaley approximation
         has converged to within tolerance.
       (c) failed: A boolean `Tensor` of the same shape as `option_prices`
         above. Indicates whether the corresponding options price is NaN or not
         a finite number. Note that converged being True implies that failed
         will be false. However, it may happen that converged is False but
         failed is not True. This indicates the search did not converge in the
         permitted number of iterations but may converge if the iterations are
         increased.

  Raises:

      (a) If both `forwards` and `spots` are supplied or if neither is supplied.
