Description: #############
        Pause on lock
        #############
        
        Automatically pause your music player when the screen gets
        locked and resume plaback, once the screen is unlocked again.
        
        This is basically `the bash script with the same name`_ rewritten in Python.
        The benefit of the Python version is that it *should* detect the screensaver
        you use and running player(s) automatically, as long, as they are visible on
        the D-Bus. So, no need for ever growing arrays of supported applications in
        the code and no configuration necessary.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Pause on Lock is available on pypi, so all you have to do is run ``pip install pauseonlock``.
        
        Usage
        =====
        After installing, simply run ``pauseonlock``. There will be no output, since the
        program is intended to be run in the background. For maximum convenience configure
        your desktop environment to start ``pauseonlock`` every time you log in.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        The only dependency is `python-dbus-next`_ which itself has no further dependencies.
