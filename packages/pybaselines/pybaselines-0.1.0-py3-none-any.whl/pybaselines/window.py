def noise_median(data, half_window, smooth_half_window=1, sigma=5.0):
    """
    The noise-median method for baseline identification.

    Assumes the baseline can be considered as the median value within a moving
    window, and the resulting baseline is then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    half_window : int
        The index-based size to use for the median window. The total window
        size will range from [-half_window, ..., half_window] with size
        2*half_window + 1.
    smooth_half_window : int, optional
        The half window to use for smoothing. Default is 1.
    sigma : float, optional
        The standard deviation of the smoothing Gaussian kernel. Default is 5.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated and smoothed baseline.
    dict
        An empty dictionary, just to match the output of all other algorithms.

         smooth_half_window=1):
    """
    Statistics-sensitive Non-linear Iterative Peak-clipping (SNIP).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points.
    max_half_window : int
        The maximum number of iterations. Should be set so that
        max_half_window=(w-1)/2, where w is the index-based width of a
        feature or peak.
    decreasing : bool, optional
        If False (default), will iterate through window sizes from 1 to
        max_half_window. If True, will reverse the order and iterate from
        max_half_window to 1, which gives a smoother baseline according to [3]_
        and [4]_.
    smooth : bool, optional
        If True, will perform a moving average smooth on the data for each window,
        which gives better results for noisy data [3]_. Default is False.
    smooth_half_window : int, optional
        The half window to use for the moving average if smooth=True. Default is 1,
        which gives a 3-point moving average.

    Returns
    -------
    z : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    dict
        An empty dictionary, just to match the output of all other algorithms.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        Raised if max_half_window is greater than (data.shape[0] - 1) // 2.

    Notes
    -----
    Algorithm initially developed by [1]_ and this specific version of the
    algorithm is adapted from [2]_ and [4]_.

    If data covers several orders of magnitude, better results can be obtained
    by first transforming the data using log-log-square transform before
    using SNIP [2]_:

        transformed_data =  np.log(np.log(np.sqrt(data + 1) + 1) + 1)

    and then baseline can then be reverted back to the original scale using inverse:

        baseline = -1 + (np.exp(np.exp(snip(transformed_data)) - 1) - 1)**2
