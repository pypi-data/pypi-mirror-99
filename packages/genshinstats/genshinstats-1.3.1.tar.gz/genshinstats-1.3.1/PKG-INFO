Description: # genshinstats
        This project is meant to be a wrapper for the Genshin Impact's [hoyolab.com](https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/) api.
        The api endpoints used in this project are not publicly known but are free to use for third part tools, so I have decided to get these a bit more publicity by making a wrapper for them.
        
        You can pip install with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/genshinstats/)
        
        # how to use
        Import the `genshinstats` module and set the cookie to login.
        To set the cookie use `set_cookie(account_id=..., cookie_token=...)`.
        Pass your own cookie values in this fields. ([How to get your cookie](#how-to-get-your-cookie))
        The cookie is required and will raise an error if missing.
        
        All functions are documented and type hinted.
        # examples
        ![showcase](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529573765743509504/820739541924446248/genshinstats_showcase_lowres.gif)
        Simple examples of usage:
        ```py
        import genshinstats as gs # import module
        gs.set_cookie(account_id=119480035, cookie_token="hEIIh08ghAIlHY1QQZBnsngVWXzaEMQtrSV0Bowu") # login
        
        uid = 710785423
        user_info = gs.get_user_info(uid) # get user info with a uid
        total_characters = len(user_info['characters']) # get the amount of characters
        print('user "sadru" has a total of',total_characters,'characters')
        ```
        > Cookies should be your own. These are just some example cookies of an account that can be deleted at any time.
        ```py
        stats = gs.get_user_info(uid)['stats']
        for field,value in stats.items():
            print(f"{field.replace('_',' ')}: {value}")
        ```
        ```py
        characters = gs.get_all_characters(uid)
        for char in characters:
            print(f"{char['rarity']}* {char['name']:10} | lvl {char['level']:2} C{char['constellation']}")
        ```
        ```py
        spiral_abyss = gs.get_spiral_abyss(uid,previous=True)
        stats = spiral_abyss['stats']
        for field,value in stats.items():
            print(f"{field.replace('_',' ')}: {value}")
        ```
        
        It's possible to set the cookies with a header
        ```py
        gs.set_cookie_header("""
        _MHYUUID=0110a95f-fbe9-41a3-a26a-5ed1d9e3a8f1; account_id=119480035; cookie_token=hEIIh08ghAIlHY1QQZBnsngVWXzaEMQtrSV0Bowu; ltoken=cnF7TiZqHAAvYqgCBoSPx5EjwezOh1ZHoqSHf7dT; ltuid=119480035; mi18nLang=en-us
        """)
        ```
        ## submodules
        ### gachalog
        Gets your gacha pull logs.
        For this you must first open the history/details page in genshin impact,
        the script will then get all required data by itself.
        ```py
        types = gs.get_gacha_types() # get all possible types
        key = types[2]['key'] # name == "Character Event Wish", key == '301'
        log = gs.get_gacha_log(key) # get the gacha log
        for i in log:
            print(f"{i['time']} - {i['name']} ({i['rarity']}* {i['type']})")
        ```
        ```py
        ids = gs.get_all_gacha_ids() # get all possible gacha ids (only counts opened details pages)
        for i in ids:
            details = gs.get_gacha_details(i) # 
            print(f"{details['gacha_type']} - {details['banner']}")
            print('5 stars:', ', '.join(i['name'] for i in details['r5_up_items']))
            print('4 stars:', ', '.join(i['name'] for i in details['r4_up_items']))
            print()
        ```
        View other's history by setting an authkey yourself:
        ```py
        # directly with the token:
        gs.set_authkey("D3ZYe49SUzpDgzrt/l00n2673Zg8N/Yd9OSc7NulRHhp8EhzlEnz2ISBtKBR0fZ/DGs8...")
        # get from a url:
        gs.set_authkey("https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/ys/event/im-service/index.html?...")
        # read from a custom file:
        gs.set_authkey(logfile='other_output_log.txt')
        ```
        > Since the authkey lasts only a day this is more like for exporting than for actual use.
        ### signin
        Automatically get daily sign in rewards for the currently logged-in user.
        ```py
        info = gs.get_daily_reward_info()
        print('total rewards claimed:',info['total_sign_day'])
        gs.sign_in() # signed you in, returns a bool whether it succeeded
        ```
        
        ## change language
        Some api endpoints support changing languages, you can see them listed here:
        ```py
        genshinstats.get_all_characters(...,lang='fr-fr')
        
        gachalog.get_gacha_types(lang='fr')
        gachalog.get_gacha_log(...,lang='fr')
        gachalog.get_gacha_items(lang='fr-fr')
        gachalog.get_gacha_details(...,lang='fr-fr')
        ```
        > endpoints can use two types of values, long and short. Long is the default value in `gs.get_langs()`, short is only the first part of a lang (`en-us` -> `en`).
        > Chinese has simplified and traditional options, so if you use chinese the short version is the same as the long version (`zh-cn` -> `zh-cn`)
        
        # how to get your cookie
        1. go to [hoyolab.com](https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/)
        2. login to your account
        3. open inspect mode (Developer Tools)
        4. go to `Application`, `Cookies`, `https://www.hoyolab.com`.
        5. copy `account_id` and `cookie_token`
        6. use `set_cookie(account_id=..., cookie_token=...)` in your code
        
        # errors
        genshinstats uses its own errors defined in `genshinstats.errors`. 
        
        The most common one you'll probably see is `DataNotPublic`.
        To solve this error You must go to [hoyolab.com](https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/accountCenter/gameRecord) and make your account public.
        ([how to make your account public](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529573765743509504/817509874417008759/make_account_public.png))

        ## contribution
        All contributions are welcome as long as it's in a form of a clean PR.
        Currently looking for literally anyone who has a chinese genshin account to help me make this project work for all chinese endpoints (right now it's mostly guesswork).
