Interval to sync container states between the database and the docker.

The interval that Zun checks the actual container state and
the state that Zun has recorded in its database. If they are inconsistent,
Zun will update the database according to the actual container state.

Possible values:
* 0: Will run at the default periodic interval.
* Any value < 0: Disables the option.
* Any positive integer in seconds.
