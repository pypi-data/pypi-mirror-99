    Introduce a CNI plugin for docker. In before, Zun was using libnetwork
    as the networking model for docker containers.
    Starting from this release, Zun introduces an alternative CNI plugin
    which implements the CNI networking model for docker containers.
    The new CNI plugin will become the default network plugin and the old
    libnetwork plugin will be deprecated.

    Deployers who are choosing CNI plugin don't need to deploy
    kuryr-libnetwork and etcd.
