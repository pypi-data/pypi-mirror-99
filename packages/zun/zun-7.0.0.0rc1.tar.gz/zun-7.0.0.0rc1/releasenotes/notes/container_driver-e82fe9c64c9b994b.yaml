upgrade:
  - |
    Starting from this release, container driver is loaded from entry point.
    Deployers should specify the entry point (i.e. ``docker``) in config option
    ``container_driver`` under ``[DEFAULT]`` session.
deprecations:
  - |
    Specifying container driver class via config option ``container_driver``
    is deprecated. Use driver name in entry point ``zun.container.driver``
    instead.
