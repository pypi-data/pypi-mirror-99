    This release supports placement integration.
features:
  - |
    In this release, Zun compute agent will report local resource
    availability/utilization to placement API.
    In addition, Zun scheduler will get allocation candidates
    from placement API and claim container allocation in placement.
upgrade:
  - |
    Since this release, operators need to configure each compute node
    that runs both Zun compute agent and Nova compute agent as follows::

      [compute]
      host_shared_with_nova = true

    By setting ``host_shared_with_nova`` to ``true``, Zun compute agent and
    Nova compute agent will share a resource provider for the compute node
    in placement. In particular, both Nova instances and Zun containers might
    claim allocation on the same resource provider.
    By default, ``host_shared_with_nova`` is ``false`` which means Zun
    compute agent will create its own resource provider for the compute node.
