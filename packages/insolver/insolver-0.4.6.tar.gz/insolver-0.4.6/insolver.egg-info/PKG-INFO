        ```
        ### Install with addons:
        
        ```shell
        pip install insolver[db-connects]
        ```
        
        ### Post-install:
        
        To fix displaying plotly figs in jyputerlab install:
        ```shell
        jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly
        ```
        
        In case of problem with `pyodbc` you may need to install:
        ```shell
        sudo apt install unixodbc-dev
        ```
        ### Insolver is already installed in the easy access cloud via GitHub login. Try https://mset.space with a familiar notebook-style environment.
