Run tests with::

  $ cd ./test
  $ python -m unittest

â€¦ from the root of the project.

Which looks for any ``*/feed.*`` files and processes them using each
``*.config`` file in the feed's directory.  The output messages are
saved (not mailed) and compared with the expected output for that
feed/config pair.  For example, with a directory structure like::

  test
  |-- data
  |   |-- allthingsrss
  |   |   |-- 1.config
  |   |   |-- 1.expected
  |   |   |-- 2.config
  |   |   |-- 2.expected
  |   |   `-- feed.atom
  |   `-- otherfeed
  |       |-- a.config
  |       |-- a.expected
  |       |-- b.config
  |       |-- b.expected
  |       `-- feed.rss
  |-- README
  `-- test.py

``test.py`` will parse:

* ``feed.atom`` after loading ``1.config`` and compare the output with
  ``1.expected``.
* ``feed.atom`` after loading ``2.config`` and compare the output with
  ``2.expected``.
* ``feed.rss`` after loading ``a.config`` and compare the output with
  ``a.expected``.
* ``feed.rss`` after loading ``b.config`` and compare the output with
  ``b.expected``.

Various other tests are also run, run test.py with the `-v`/`--verbose` option to
see exactly which tests are being run:

  $ cd ./test
  $ python -m unittest --verbose
