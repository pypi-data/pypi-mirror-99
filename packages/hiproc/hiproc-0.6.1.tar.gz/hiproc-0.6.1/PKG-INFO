        A library to help process HiRISE EDRs with ISIS.

        Features
        --------
        
        * TODO: Complete testing against Perl Pipelines.
        
        
        External Dependencies
        ---------------------
        These programs use as much 'vanilla' Python 3 as possible.
        
        However, it does depend on the following:
        
        - pvl library (https://pvl.readthedocs.io)
        - kalasiris library (https://kalasiris.readthedocs.io)
        - gdal
        - numpy
        - scipy
        - matplotlib
        
        The HiJACK program also requires the ``resolveJitter`` program that
        is still buggy, and is not working reliably.
        
        Warning !
        ---------
        
        The algorithms based on the HiRISE Processing Pipelines were emulated
        and tested locally, but the results of each pipeline **have not**
        been tested directly against the results of the HiRISE Processing
        Pipelines, and this warning will remain until I have done so.  As
        a result, I would not particularly 'trust' anything produced by
        these programs at this time, and consider these algorithms a
        work-in-progress.
        
        These programs have been tested against their upstream Perl counterparts:
        
        - EDR_Stats: Verified!
            Really just runs ``hi2isis`` so no surprise here.
        
        - HiCal: Verified. (if ``HiGainFx()`` enabled)
            Upstream is undergoing change.  HiGainFx really shouldn't be
            applied, so it is commented out here.  We're also working
            to integrate the bitflip cleaning into the upstream Perl,
            so this is in flux.
        
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        Feedback, issues, and contributions are always gratefully welcomed. See the
        contributing guide for details on how to help and setup a development
        environment.
        
        
        Naming
        ------
        
        The ISIS software has a number of processing or "proc" programs
        (`mocproc`, `thmproc`, etc.) that are meant to be run to process
        raw images to higher-level, more usable versions.  Naming this
        library `hiproc` is an echo to that. There is a `hiproc` program
        that is available after installation that provides a streamlined
        one-stop-program, but this package provides a great deal more.

        Unreleased
        ----------
        
        0.6.1 (2021-03-23)
        ------------------
        
        Added
        +++++
        - lisfix will return a non-zero exit code if it chooses not to fix the input cube.
        
        Changed
        +++++++
        - Updated documentation in various places.
        
        
        0.6.0 (2021-03-18)
        ------------------
        
        Added
        +++++
        - More complete documentation for the programs and their parameters.
        
        Changed
        +++++++
        - Implemented better handling for configuration files so that they
          will get distributed with the package.
        
        
        0.5.0 (2021-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        Added
        +++++
        * lisfix: Added the lisfix module.
        * bitflips: Sometimes the very end of the histogram (although not a formal minima) is the
          appropriate choice, and is now considered.
        * bitflips: Added capability to ignore minor maxima at the ends of the histogram to "roll down"
          to a better solution.
        
        Changed
        +++++++
        * name change of project from pyrise to hiproc.
        * bitflips: Changed the default medstd_limit from 300 to 400 DN.
        
        Fixed
        +++++
        * bitflips: There were a variety of edge cases that resulted in errors.  The appropriate guardrails, handlers,
          and recovery logic has now been added.
        * HiStitch: The equalize and balance parameters cannot both be true.
        
        0.4.0 (2020-09-22)
        ------------------
        * Tremendous amount of re-working in bitflips to improve
          performance.
        * Format cleanup
        
        0.3.0 (2020-05-16)
        ------------------
        * Confirmed that EDR_Stats and HiCal produce identical output cubes.
        
        0.2.0 (2020-05-06)
        ------------------
        * Updated with bit-flip correction.
