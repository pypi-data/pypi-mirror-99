    FLAWS WITH DOSE
    CRPA and RPR are hardcoded
    the lonedrone risk is not accounted for in fig 4, 5
        but is in 6, and isn't in their code
    attackers randomly attack with 1/8 chance
        -not stated in the paper, makes algos do better
    number of relays can 16X with just one attacker/1k users?
    potentially more with more users (or attackers?)
    with RPR set to 1, lone drone cost forces 1 user to a bucket?
    
    more verbosely written:
    Here is a list of some of the flaws we discovered from DOSE.
    There were more, but after reading/running their code and becoming
    thoroughly convinced their results were fabricated/wrong,
    I stopped recording them.
    
    CRPA and RPR were hardcoded in their code, even though you can accept
    them as a parameter. In other words, if you pass in a parameter to set
    the CRPA or RPR, behind the scenes they would always be changed to be
    hardcoded
    
    The lone drone risk is not accounted for in figures 4, 5
    and it is in 6. However, their algorithm clearly states
    the lone drone risk is supposed to be factored into their
    suspicion. If you always consider lone drone risk, with
    the parameters they have in their own code their algorithm
    has terrible results (which aren't shown in their graphs,
    since they omitted this when convenient). Every user will
    have to go into their own bucket. Their code clearly does
    not function the way they wrote their paper. Even
    theoretically/mathematically, the graphs they present are
    not possible to produce with the way their algorithm is
    written. They simply pick and choose to use lone drone risk
    whenever it is convenient to their results.
    
    Attackers attack with 1/8 chance, however I don't see this
    mentioned in their paper. Their algorithm doesn't care if
    the attacker attacks every round or not, so this essentially
    just boosts their stats and makes their results seem better
    than they are.
    
    With just 1 attacker per 1000 users, the number of
    relays/buckets increases by a factor of 16 (I think this
    was figure four) and maintain these buckets for multiple
    rounds? With more attackers or more users this number would
    be even higher. That seems like a very expensive way to catch
    just one attacker.
    
    They never state how they combine buckets. In fact, their code
    does not do it. Even when we run their code to produce the
    graphs they have in the paper, they produce graphs that do not
    have combined buckets. It would appear as if they simply added
    an extra data point for this that was not represented in their
    code. So as far as I can tell their algorithm does not specify
    how to combine buckets and there is no implementation for it.
    This matters, since multiple attackers attacking in different
    combinations make simple combining algorithms perform poorly.
    
    The graphs we got when we ran their code seemed to indicate they
    added data points they didn't have, and had no implementation to get.
    
    Their code was written horribly, with little to no documentation,
    hard coded variables, hundreds of lines of discarded code.
    Ripe for errors.
