Description: # Delphix Integration Library and CLI (dxi)
        dxi is a solution from Delphix, 
        built to facilitate simpler and seamless integration of Delphix Platform Operations into your existing workflows. 
        dxi offers a feature rich command line interface (cli) for users who prefer to use their terminals or shell scripts to trigger data operations. 
        dxi is also a Python Library and can be used by those who need to control their data through code or integrate data operations into their existing applications.

        ## What is Delphix? 
        Delphix is a platform that provides you with the ability to securely copy and share datasets. 
        Using virtualization, you will ingest your data sources and create any number of virtual data copies, 
        which are full read-write capable database instances that use an infinitesimally small fraction of the 
        resources that normal database copy would require. ​
