PREREQUISITES
=============

- `git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__
- `python3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
- `make <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/make/>`__ (for ``make install``)
- `cmake <https://cmake.org/install/>`__ (for ``cmake build``)
- `go <https://golang.org/doc/install>`__ (for ``go install``)
- `meson/ninja <https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html>`__ (for meson build, ninja install)
- `bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`__
    - Although ``pspman`` itself does not require `bash`, all exports (PATH, PYTHONPATH) are made for `bash`, which is a commonly used shell. If you use any other shell, you need to export PATH and PYTHONPATH. A pull request on `init <https://github.com/pradyparanjpe/pspman/blob/master/pspman/psp_in.py>`__ is welcome.

`That's all!`

    pip install -U pspman
