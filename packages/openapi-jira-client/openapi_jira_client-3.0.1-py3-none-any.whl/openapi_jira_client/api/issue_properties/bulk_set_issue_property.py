    The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/).

Expressions must also comply with the [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions) that apply to all Jira expressions.

    The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.

    The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:

     *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.
     *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.
     *  `hasProperty`:

         *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.

    If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.

    If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value).

    The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.
