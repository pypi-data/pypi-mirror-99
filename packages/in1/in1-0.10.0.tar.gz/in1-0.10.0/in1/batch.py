    """Applies an operation to a raster in batched fashion.

    This function tiles its input, each tile being a batch item, to support processing
    large files.

    Arguments
    ---------
    raster: Union[str, np.ndarray, rio.MemoryFile]
        The source raster to operate upon. Can be a filepath, a numpy raster shaped
        [C, H, W], or a rasterio MemoryFile.
    operation: Callable[[bytes], bytes]
        The operation the batch processor should apply. This is expected to be the
        `inference.infer` function with all its paramters filled, except for the
        raster parameter. The batch processor will read tiles from its own raster,
        convert such a tile to bytes, which the infer function will then send to the
        server.
    calc_metrics: bool
        Set to true if the operation returns metrics as well. The batch processor needs
        this to know so it can

    Returns
    -------
    A rasterio MemoryFile with the result raster.
