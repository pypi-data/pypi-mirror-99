Description: # nnde
        
        nnde is a package of Python modules which implement a set of neural networks which solve ordinary and partial differential equations using technique of [Lagaris et al. (1998)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/72.712178).
        
        The package is described in [Winter and Weigel, 2021](https://github.com/elwinter/nnde_joss_paper), the source code for the paper is in the repository [elwinter/nnde_joss_paper](https://github.com/elwinter/nnde_joss_paper).
        
        Demos are available in the repository [nnde_demos](https://github.com/elwinter/nnde_demos).
