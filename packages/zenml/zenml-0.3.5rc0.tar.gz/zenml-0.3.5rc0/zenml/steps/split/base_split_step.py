        To be eligible in use in a Split Step, the partition_fn has to adhere
        to the following design contract:

        1. The signature is of the following type:

            >>> def partition_fn(element, n, **kwargs) -> int,

            where n is the number of splits;
        2. The partition_fn only returns signed integers i less than n, i.e. ::
