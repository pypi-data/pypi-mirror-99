# Semi-classical Langevin Molecular Dynamics

This is a set of scripts to run semi-classical Langevin molecular dynamics on junctions connecting to several electron or phonon baths. The details of the method are presented in Prog. Surf. Sci. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.progsurf.2018.07.002].

To do the molecular dynamics, we need a force driver. Currently, we implemented Siesta, Brenner and LAMMPS potentials.

The important feature of this script is that, the statistics of the bath degrees of freeom is quantum. For example, the zero point fluctuations are included; they fulfill the quantum-mechanical Bose-Einstein distribution. Moreover, the electron bath is allowed to be in a nonequilibrium steady state (non-thermal).

## Install

Install LAMMPS and required python packages, which can be done by following script.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# install.sh Compile & install LAMMPS shared library with IntelÂ® oneAPI HPC Toolkit https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi.html & required packages in python
# Usage: sh install.sh
# -------------------------------------------------------
if [ -d 'lammps' ]
then
    echo 'LAMMPS already exists' 
else
    echo 'Download LAMMPS source code'
    git clone https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git -b stable
fi
echo 'Activate Intel compilation environment'
source source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
cd lammps/src
echo 'Select LAMMPS packages'
make yes-body yes-class2 yes-manybody yes-molecule yes-kspace yes-user-reaxc yes-user-phonon
echo 'Compile LAMMPS shared library'
make -j 8 intel_cpu_intelmpi mode=shlib
echo 'Install LAMMPS shared library in python'
make install-python
echo 'Compile LAMMPS executable file'
make -j 8 intel_cpu_intelmpi
echo 'Install required python packages'
python -m pip install -U sclmd
```
