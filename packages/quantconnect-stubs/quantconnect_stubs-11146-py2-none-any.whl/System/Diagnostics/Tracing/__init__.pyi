        This is because in most cases users assume logging is not 'precious' and do NOT wish to have logging failures
        crash the program. However for those applications where logging is 'precious' and if it fails the caller
        wishes to react, setting 'throwOnEventWriteErrors' will cause an exception to be thrown if WriteEvent
        fails. Note the fact that EventWrite succeeds does not necessarily mean that the event reached its destination
        only that operation of writing it did not fail. These EventSources will not generate self-describing ETW events.
        
        For compatibility only use the EventSourceSettings.ThrowOnEventWriteErrors flag instead.

class EventListener(System.Object, System.IDisposable):
    """
    An EventListener represents a target for the events generated by EventSources (that is subclasses
    of EventSource), in the current appdomain. When a new EventListener is created
    it is logically attached to all eventSources in that appdomain. When the EventListener is Disposed, then
    it is disconnected from the event eventSources. Note that there is a internal list of STRONG references
    to EventListeners, which means that relying on the lack of references to EventListeners to clean up
    EventListeners will NOT work. You must call EventListener.Dispose explicitly when a dispatcher is no
    longer needed.
    
    Once created, EventListeners can enable or disable on a per-eventSource basis using verbosity levels
    () and bitfields () to further restrict the set of
    events to be sent to the dispatcher. The dispatcher can also send arbitrary commands to a particular
    eventSource using the 'SendCommand' method. The meaning of the commands are eventSource specific.
    
    The Null Guid (that is (new Guid()) has special meaning as a wildcard for 'all current eventSources in
    the appdomain'. Thus it is relatively easy to turn on all events in the appdomain if desired.
    
    It is possible for there to be many EventListener's defined in a single appdomain. Each dispatcher is
    logically independent of the other listeners. Thus when one dispatcher enables or disables events, it
    affects only that dispatcher (other listeners get the events they asked for). It is possible that
    commands sent with 'SendCommand' would do a semantic operation that would affect the other listeners
    (like doing a GC, or flushing data ...), but this is the exception rather than the rule.
    
    Thus the model is that each EventSource keeps a list of EventListeners that it is sending events
    to. Associated with each EventSource-dispatcher pair is a set of filtering criteria that determine for
    that eventSource what events that dispatcher will receive.
    
    Listeners receive the events on their 'OnEventWritten' method. Thus subclasses of EventListener must
    override this method to do something useful with the data.
    
    In addition, when new eventSources are created, the 'OnEventSourceCreate' method is called. The
    invariant associated with this callback is that every eventSource gets exactly one
    'OnEventSourceCreate' call for ever eventSource that can potentially send it log messages. In
    particular when a EventListener is created, typically a series of OnEventSourceCreate' calls are
