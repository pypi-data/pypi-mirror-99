# QuantConnect Stubs

This package contains type stubs for QuantConnect's [Lean](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) algorithmic trading engine and for parts of the .NET library that are used by Lean.

These stubs can be used by editors to provide type-aware features like autocompletion and auto-imports in QuantConnect strategies written in Python.
