.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new virtual cloud network (VCN). For more information, see \fI\%VCNs and Subnets\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the VCN, you specify a list of one or more IPv4 CIDR blocks that meet the following criteria:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The CIDR blocks must be valid. \- They must not overlap with each other or with the on\-premises network CIDR block. \- The number of CIDR blocks does not exceed the limit of CIDR blocks allowed per VCN.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For a CIDR block, Oracle recommends that you use one of the private IP address ranges specified in \fI\%RFC 1918\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918\fP> (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example: 172.16.0.0/16. The CIDR blocks can range from /16 to /30.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the VCN to reside. Consult an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the subnets or other Networking Service components. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the VCN, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
You can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the instances to use the Interent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN. For more information, see \fI\%DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options. The OCID for each is returned in the response. You can\(aqt delete these default objects, but you can change their contents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on).
.sp
The VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an internet gateway or set up an IPSec VPN or FastConnect. For more information, see \fI\%Overview of the Networking Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.

The list of one or more IPv4 CIDR blocks for the VCN that meet the following criteria: \- The CIDR blocks must be valid. \- They must not overlap with each other or with the on\-premises network CIDR block. \- The number of CIDR blocks must not exceed the limit of CIDR blocks allowed per VCN.

\fBImportant:\fP Do \fInot\fP specify a value for \fIcidrBlock\fP\&. Use this parameter instead.

.TP
.B \-\-dns\-label [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A DNS label for the VCN, used in conjunction with the VNIC\(aqs hostname and subnet\(aqs DNS label to form a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for each VNIC within this subnet (for example, \fIbminstance\-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com\fP). Not required to be unique, but it\(aqs a best practice to set unique DNS labels for VCNs in your tenancy. Must be an alphanumeric string that begins with a letter. The value cannot be changed.
.sp
You must set this value if you want instances to be able to use hostnames to resolve other instances in the VCN. Otherwise the Internet and VCN Resolver will not work.

.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp

.B \-\-ipv6\-cidr\-block [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you enable IPv6 for the VCN (see \fIisIpv6Enabled\fP), you may optionally provide an IPv6 /48 CIDR block from the supported ranges (see \fI\%IPv6 Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm\fP>\&. The addresses in this block will be considered private and cannot be accessed from the internet. The documentation refers to this as a \fIcustom CIDR\fP for the VCN.
.sp
If you don\(aqt provide a custom CIDR for the VCN, Oracle assigns the VCN\(aqs IPv6 /48 CIDR block.
.sp
Regardless of whether you or Oracle assigns the \fIipv6CidrBlock\fP, Oracle \fIalso\fP assigns the VCN an IPv6 CIDR block for the VCN\(aqs public IP address space (see the \fIipv6PublicCidrBlock\fP of the \fI\%Vcn\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vcn/\fP> object). If you do not assign a custom CIDR, Oracle uses the \fIsame\fP Oracle\-assigned CIDR for both the private IP address space (\fIipv6CidrBlock\fP in the \fIVcn\fP object) and the public IP addreses space (\fIipv6PublicCidrBlock\fP in the \fIVcn\fP object). This means that a given VNIC might use the same IPv6 IP address for both private and public (internet) communication. You control whether an IPv6 address can be used for internet communication by using the \fIisInternetAccessAllowed\fP attribute in the \fI\%Ipv6\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Ipv6/\fP> object.
.sp

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
