The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

.B \-\-is\-acl\-enabled [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Indicates if the database\-level access control is enabled. If disabled, database access is defined by the network security rules. If enabled, database access is restricted to the IP addresses defined by the rules specified with the \fIwhitelistedIps\fP property. While specifying \fIwhitelistedIps\fP rules is optional,  if database\-level access control is enabled and no rules are specified, the database will become inaccessible. The rules can be added later using the \fIUpdateAutonomousDatabase\fP API operation or edit option in console. When creating a database clone, the desired access control setting should be specified. By default, database\-level access control will be disabled for the clone.
.sp
This property is applicable only to Autonomous Databases on the Exadata \fI\%Cloud@Customer\fP <\fBCloud@Customer\fP> platform.
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B \-\-is\-free\-tier [boolean]
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.sp
If set to \fITRUE\fP, indicates that an Autonomous Database preview version is being provisioned, and that the preview version\(aqs terms of service have been accepted.

.B \-\-license\-model [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Oracle license model that applies to the Oracle Autonomous Database. Bring your own license (BYOL) allows you to apply your current on\-premises Oracle software licenses to equivalent, highly automated Oracle PaaS and IaaS services in the cloud. License Included allows you to subscribe to new Oracle Database software licenses and the Database service. Note that when provisioning an Autonomous Database on \fI\%dedicated Exadata infrastructure\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Concepts/adbddoverview.htm\fP>, this attribute must be null because the attribute is already set at the Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure level. When using \fI\%shared Exadata infrastructure\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI\fP>, if a value is not specified, the system will supply the value of \fIBRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.sp
A list of the \fI\%OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the network security groups (NSGs) that this resource belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see \fI\%Security Rules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm\fP>\&. \fBNsgIds restrictions:\fP \- Autonomous Databases with private access require at least 1 Network Security Group (NSG). The nsgIds array cannot be empty.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-private\-endpoint\-label [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-standby\-whitelisted\-ips [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The client IP access control list (ACL). This feature is available for autonomous databases on \fI\%shared Exadata infrastructure\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI\fP> and on Exadata \fI\%Cloud@Customer\fP <\fBCloud@Customer\fP>\&. Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance.
.sp
For shared Exadata infrastructure, this is an array of CIDR (Classless Inter\-Domain Routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID. Use a semicolon (;) as a deliminator between the VCN\-specific subnets or IPs. Example: \fI["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id>","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id1>;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id2>;1.1.0.0/16"]\fP For Exadata \fI\%Cloud@Customer\fP <\fBCloud@Customer\fP>, this is an array of IP addresses or CIDR (Classless Inter\-Domain Routing) notations. Example: \fI["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","1.1.2.25"]\fP
.sp
For an update operation, if you want to delete all the IPs in the ACL, use an array with a single empty string entry.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

.B \-\-subnet\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the subnet the resource is associated with.
.sp
\fBSubnet Restrictions:\fP \- For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28. \- For Exadata and virtual machine 2\-node RAC systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20. \- For Autonomous Database, setting this will disable public secure access to the database.
.sp
These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
