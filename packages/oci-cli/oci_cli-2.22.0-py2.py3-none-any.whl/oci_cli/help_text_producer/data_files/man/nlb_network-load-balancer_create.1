.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-backend\-sets [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Backend sets associated with the network load balancer.
.sp
This option is a JSON dictionary of type dict(str, BackendSetDetails).  For documentation on BackendSetDetails please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/networkloadbalancer/20200501/datatypes/BackendSetDetails\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: \fI{"foo\-namespace": {"bar\-key": "value"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Simple key\-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type, or scope. Exists for cross\-compatibility only. Example: \fI{"bar\-key": "value"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-is\-preserve\-source\-destination [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This parameter can be enabled only if backends are compute OCIDs. When enabled, the skipSourceDestinationCheck parameter is automatically enabled on the load balancer VNIC, and packets are sent to the backend with the entire IP header intact.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-is\-private [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Whether the network load balancer has a virtual cloud network\-local (private) IP address.
.sp
If "true", then the service assigns a private IP address to the network load balancer.
.sp
If "false", then the service assigns a public IP address to the network load balancer.
.sp
A public network load balancer is accessible from the internet, depending on the \fI\%security list rules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/network/Concepts/securitylists.htm\fP> for your virtual cloud network. For more information about public and private network load balancers, see \fI\%How Network Load Balancing Works\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Concepts/balanceoverview.htm#how-network-load-balancing-works\fP>\&. This value is true by default.

.sp
Listeners associated with the network load balancer.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-network\-security\-group\-ids [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
An array of network security groups \fI\%OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> associated with the network load balancer.
.sp
During the creation of the network load balancer, the service adds the new load balancer to the specified network security groups.
.sp
The benefits of associating the network load balancer with network security groups include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Network security groups define network security rules to govern ingress and egress traffic for the network load balancer.
.IP \(bu 2
The network security rules of other resources can reference the network security groups associated with the network load balancer    to ensure access.

.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
