Description
===========

A dynamic routing gateway (DRG), which is a virtual router that
provides a path for private network traffic between your VCN and your
existing network. You use it with other Networking Service components
to create an IPSec VPN or a connection that uses Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure FastConnect. For more information, see Overview of the
Networking Service.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
