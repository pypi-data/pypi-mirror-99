Description
===========

Quotas are applied on top of the service limits and inherited through
the nested compartment hierarchy. They allow compartment admins to
limit resource consumption and set boundaries around acceptable
resource use. The word "quota" is used by people in different ways:
* An individual statement written in the declarative language   * A
collection of statements in a single, named "quota" object (which has
an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it)   * The overall body of
quotas your organization uses to control access to resources
