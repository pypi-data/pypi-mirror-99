file-system
***********


Description
===========

An NFS file system. To allow access to a file system, add it to an
export set and associate the export set with a mount target. The same
file system can be in multiple export sets and associated with
multiple mount targets.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
