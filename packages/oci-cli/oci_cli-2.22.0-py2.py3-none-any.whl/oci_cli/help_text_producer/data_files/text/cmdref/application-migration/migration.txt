Description
===========

The properties that define a migration. A migration represents the
end-to-end workflow of moving an application from a source environment
to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Each migration moves a single
application to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. For more information, see
Manage Migrations.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
