Usage
=====

   oci dns resolver-endpoint create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--is-forwarding [boolean]

A Boolean flag indicating whether or not the resolver endpoint is for
forwarding.

--is-listening [boolean]

A Boolean flag indicating whether or not the resolver endpoint is for
listening.

--name [text]

The name of the resolver endpoint. Must be unique within the resolver.

--resolver-id [text]

The OCID of the target resolver.


Optional Parameters
===================

--endpoint-type [text]

The type of resolver endpoint. VNIC is currently the only supported
type.

Accepted values are:

   VNIC

--forwarding-address [text]

An IP address from which forwarded queries may be sent. For VNIC
endpoints, this IP address must be part of the subnet and will be
assigned by the system if unspecified when isForwarding is true.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--listening-address [text]

An IP address to listen to queries on. For VNIC endpoints this IP
address must be part of the subnet and will be assigned by the system
if unspecified.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--scope [text]

Specifies to operate only on resources that have a matching DNS scope.

Accepted values are:

   GLOBAL, PRIVATE

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING, FAILED, UPDATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
