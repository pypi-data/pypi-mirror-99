job
***


Description
===========

The properties that define a job. Jobs perform the actions that are
defined in your configuration. - **Plan job**. A plan job takes your
Terraform configuration, parses it, and creates an execution plan. -
**Apply job**. The apply job takes your execution plan, applies it to
the associated stack, then executes the configuration's instructions.
- **Destroy job**. To clean up the infrastructure controlled by the
stack, you run a destroy job. A destroy job does not delete the stack
or associated job resources, but instead releases the resources
managed by the stack. - **Import_TF_State job**. An import Terraform
state job takes a Terraform state file and sets it as the current
state of the stack. This is used to migrate local Terraform
environments to Resource Manager.
