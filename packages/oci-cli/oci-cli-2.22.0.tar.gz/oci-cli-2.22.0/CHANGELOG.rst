Added
~~~~~~~~

* A warning message informing use of ``--all`` flag to get all items during list operations.

Fixed
~~~~~~~~
* Multipart bulk download to correctly enable downloads as per size thresholds set by the user.

2.4.19 - 2018-03-26
---------------------
Added

* Support for calling Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services in the uk-london-1 (LHR) region

Changed
~~~~~~~~
* When listing audit events (``oci audit event list``) the ``--start-time`` and ``--end-time`` parameters specify values with granularity to the minute. If you provide values which have non-zero seconds or milliseconds, these will be rounded to the nearest minute with greater than or equal to 30 seconds rounding upwards and less than 30 seconds rounding downwards

Fixed
~~~~~~~
* When providing a datetime parameter to the CLI, v2.4.18 and below did not parse datetimes correctly but instead of failing they silently coverted values to midnight of the date provided and sent this value to the service. This version fixes the datetime parsing and the following inputs will be considered valid:

  * ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssTZD`` (UTC) with milliseconds, e.g. 2017-09-15T20:30:00.123Z
  * ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD`` (UTC) without milliseconds, e.g. 2017-09-15T20:30:00Z
  * ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmTZD`` (UTC) with minute precision, e.g. 2017-09-15T20:30Z
  * ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD`` (timzone with offset) with milliseconds, e.g. 2017-09-15T12:30:00.456-08:00, 2017-09-15T12:30:00.456-0800
  * ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD`` (timezone with offset) without milliseconds, e.g. 2017-09-15T12:30:00-08:00, 2017-09-15T12:30:00-0800
  * ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmTZD`` (timezone with offset) with minute precision, e.g. 2017-09-15T12:35-08:00, 2017-09-15T12:35-0800
  * ``YYYY-MM-DD``, e.g. 2017-09-15. This date will be taken as midnight UTC of that day
  * Unix time in seconds, e.g. 1412195400

Security Notice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Versions of oci-cli prior to 2.4.10 are affected by a security vulnerability. Versions 2.4.11 and later will automatically detect vulnerable installations, and if issues are detected, a warning will be displayed to the user.
