.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new object or overwrites an existing one.
.sp
The object can be uploaded as a single part or as multiple parts. Below are the rules for whether an object will be uploaded via single or multipart upload (listed in order of precedence):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the object is being uploaded from STDIN, it will be uploaded as a multipart upload (if the object content is smaller than \-\-part\-size, default for STDIN is 10 MiB, the multipart upload may contain only one part, but it will still use the MultipartUpload API)
.IP \(bu 2
If the \-\-no\-multipart flag is specified, the object will be uploaded as a single part regardless of size (specifying \-\-no\-multipart when uploading from STDIN will result in an error)
.IP \(bu 2
If the object is larger than \-\-part\-size, it will be uploaded as multiple parts
.IP \(bu 2
If the object is empty it will be uploaded as a single part

.UNINDENT
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-bn, \-\-bucket\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The name of the bucket.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-file [filename]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The file to load as the content of the object, or \(aq\-\(aq to read from STDIN.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-control [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Cache\-Control header that defines the caching behavior value to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to identify objects that require caching restrictions.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-disposition [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Disposition header that defines presentational information for the object to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to let users download objects with custom filenames in a browser.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-encoding [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Encoding header that defines the content encodings that were applied to the object to upload. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to determine what decoding mechanisms need to be applied to obtain the media\-type specified by the Content\-Type header of the object.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-language [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Language header that defines the content language of the object to upload. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to identify and differentiate objects based on a particular language.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-md5 [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional base\-64 header that defines the encoded MD5 hash of the body. If the optional Content\-MD5 header is present, Object Storage performs an integrity check on the body of the HTTP request by computing the MD5 hash for the body and comparing it to the MD5 hash supplied in the header. If the two hashes do not match, the object is rejected and an HTTP\-400 Unmatched Content MD5 error is returned with the message:
"The computed MD5 of the request body (ACTUAL_MD5) does not match the Content\-MD5 header (HEADER_MD5)"
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-content\-type [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional Content\-Type header that defines the standard MIME type format of the object. Content type defaults to \(aqapplication/octet\-stream\(aq if not specified in the PutObject call. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to identify and perform special operations on text only objects.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-parallel\-uploads
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the object will be uploaded in multiple parts, this option disables those parts from being uploaded in parallel.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-encryption\-key\-file [filename]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A file containing the base64\-encoded string of the AES\-256 encryption key associated with the object.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-force
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the object name already exists, overwrite the existing object without a confirmation prompt.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-multipart
.UNINDENT
.sp
Do not use multipart uploads to upload the file in parts. By default files above 128 MiB will be uploaded in multiple parts, then combined server\-side.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-overwrite
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the object name already exists, do not overwrite the existing object.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-parallel\-upload\-count [integer range]
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the object will be uploaded in multiple parts, this option allows you to specify the maximum number of parts that can be uploaded in parallel. This option cannot be used with \-\-disable\-parallel\-uploads or \-\-no\-multipart. Defaults to 3 and the maximum is 1000.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-part\-size [integer]
