Description
===========

An ESXi host is a node in an SDDC. At a minimum, each SDDC has 3 ESXi
hosts that are used to implement a functioning VMware environment.

In terms of implementation, an ESXi host is a Compute instance that is
configured with the chosen bundle of VMware software.

Notice that an *EsxiHost* object has its own OCID (*id*), and a
separate attribute for the OCID of the Compute instance
(*computeInstanceId*).
