Description
===========

Creates a topic in the specified compartment. For general information
about topics, see Managing Topics and Subscriptions.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the topic to reside. For information about
access control and compartments, see Overview of the IAM Service.

You must specify a display name for the topic.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including topics, get an
Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).
When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You
can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on
that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. For
more information, see Resource Identifiers.

Transactions Per Minute (TPM) per-tenancy limit for this operation:
60.


Usage
=====

   oci ons topic create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment to create the topic in.

--name [text]

The name of the topic being created. The topic name must be unique
across the tenancy. Avoid entering confidential information.


Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--description [text]

The description of the topic being created. Avoid entering
confidential information.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
