instance
********


Description
===========

A compute host. The image used to launch the instance determines its
operating system and other software. The shape specified during the
launch process determines the number of CPUs and memory allocated to
the instance. For more information, see Overview of the Compute
Service.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
