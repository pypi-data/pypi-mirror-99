    "notes": "Unlike most other color schemes cubehelix was designed by D.A. Green to be monotonically increasing in termsof perceived brightness. Also, when printed on a black and white postscript printer, the scheme results in agreyscale with monotonically increasing brightness. This color scheme is named cubehelix because the (r, g, b)values produced can be visualised as a squashed helix around the diagonal in the (r, g, b) color cube.",
