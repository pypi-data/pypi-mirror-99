CmLib
===============================

CmLib (color map library) is a collection of color maps, which originate from
different sources and that have been converted to a uniform format.

CmLib comes with PyQt widgets to view the collection and select a color map.
However, you don't need Python to use the color maps because the data is
stored in comma separated files, which can be read in any programming language.
