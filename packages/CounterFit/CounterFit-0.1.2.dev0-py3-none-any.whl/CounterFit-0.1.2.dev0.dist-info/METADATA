# CounterFit

IoT is great fun, but has a downside - hardware. You need access to a range of devices such as sensors and actuators to build your IoT projects. Sometimes you might have these devices, other times you may not - maybe you are waiting for a delivery, or parts are out of stock, or they are too expensive.

That's where this tool comes in.

## What is CounterFit

CounterFit is a tool that is designed to simulated various IoT hardware components, such as LEDs, buttons, temperature sensors and the like. It is made of two parts:

* The CounterFit app - this is a web app run locally where you can connect virtual sensors and actuators to your virtual hardware
* Shims - these are libraries that mimic popular hardware APIs so you can take code that runs against well known hardware and run it against the CounterFit app.

## Getting started

* Install the CounterFit app:

    ```sh
    pip install CounterFit
    ```

* Run the app:

    ```sh
    CounterFit
    ```
