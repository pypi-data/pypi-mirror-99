    A notification is a lightweight message that needs to be delivered to
    one or more recipients.  It informs the recipients about an event
    that occurs, which might require fetching additional data from the
    server platform or requesting the recipient to perform some action.

    A recipient is generally a client application that acts on behalf of a
    user, but it could also be an agent or botnet that controls a device.

    A message can be delivered to a recipient using different styles of
    network communication:

    * `email`: the message is delivered in an Internet electronic mail
      message to the specified recipients based on a store-and-forward
      model.

    * `push`: the message is delivered to the specified recipients
      when the request for the transmission of information is initiated
      by the publisher or server platform and pushed out to the receiver
      or client application.

    * `pull`: the message is delivered to the specified recipients
      when the request for the transmission of information is initiated
      by the receiver or client application, and then is responded by the
      publisher or server platform.  Push style requires recipients to
      register with the server platform before it can receive messages
      using this mode.

            to or from the Internet, you need to configure it to allow
            connectivity with GCM in order for your GCM client apps to receive
            messages. The ports to open are: 5228, 5229, and 5230. GCM
            typically only uses 5228, but it sometimes uses 5229 and 5230. GCM
            doesn't provide specific IPs, so you should allow your firewall to

        :note: the function registers the device on behalf of the application
            identification of the server platform, not the identification of
            the client application itself.  An instance of a server platform
            is specific to a particular service to which client applications,
            whatever their platform (Android, iOS, Web, etc.) and therefore
            whatever their application identification, are interested in
            receiving push notifications.


        @todo: the argument "topics" is not used at the moment.


        :param app_id: identification of the client application such as a Web,
            a desktop, or a mobile application, that accesses the service.

        :param device_id: identification of the device, which depends on the
            device platform:

            * Android: International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number
              of the device.

            * iOS: unique identifier of the iOS device, previously the
              Unique Device Identifier (UDID) of the device, which is a
              40-character string that is tied to this specific Apple device.
              It could be a SecureUDID, which is an open-source sandboxed UDID
              solution aimed at solving the main privacy issues that caused
              Apple to deprecate UDIDs.

        :param device_token: token that identifies the device by the push
            notification provider of the device platform.

            * Android: token identifying the device to push the notification
              to, i.e., the registration ID.  A device token is an opaque
              identifier of a device that Android Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)
              gives to the device when it first connects with it.  The device
              shares the device token with its provider. The device token is
              analogous to a phone number; it contains information that enables
              GCM to locate the device on which the client application is
              installed.  GCM also uses it to authenticate the routing of a
              notification.

            * iOS: token identifying the iOS device to push the notification
              to.  A device token is an opaque identifier of a device that APNs
              gives to the device when it first connects with it.  The device
              shares the device token with its provider. Thereafter, this token
              accompanies each notification from the provider.  The device
              token is analogous to a phone number; it contains information
              that enables APNs to locate the device on which the client
              application is installed. APNs also uses it to authenticate the
              routing of a notification.  A device token is not the same thing
              as the device UDID returned by the `uniqueIdentifier` property
              of `UIDevice`.

        :param device_platform: indicate the platform of the end user's mobile
            device:

            * `ios`: Apple iOS

            * `android`: Google Android

            * `windows`: Windows Phone

        :param account_id: identification of the account of the user on behalf
            of whom the device is registered to receive push notification
            messages.

        :param locale: represent the language that the end user prefers
            receiving new content in.  A locale corresponds to a tag
            respecting RFC 4646, expressed by a ISO 639-3 alpha-3 code
            element, optionally followed by a dash character `-` and a ISO
            3166-1 alpha-2 code.  For example: "eng" (which denotes a standard
            English), "eng-US" (which denotes an American English).  If this
            argument is not specified, the locale corresponds to the preferred
            language that the user has defined in his profile.

        :param topics: a list of keywords representing topics the end user is
            interested in to be pushed new content whenever related to one of
            those topics.  The list of supported keywords is specific to the
            publisher service of the client application and as such the
            developer of the client application has to refer to the technical
            documentation of the publisher service.

        :param utc_offset: difference between the location of the device and
            UTC (Universal Time Coordinated).  UTC is also known as GMT or
            Greenwich Mean Time or Zulu Time.

            of the same type may have a different payload.

              transmission of information is initiated by the receiver or client
              application, and then is responded by the publisher or server
              platform.

            * `push`: indicate that a notification message is delivered to the
              specified recipients when the request for the transmission of
              information is initiated by the publisher or server platform and
              pushed out to the receiver or client application.

        :param payload: any arbitrary JSON expression added by the sender to
            provide information about the context of this notification.

        :param sender_id: identification of the sender on behalf whom the
            notification is sent to the recipients.

        :param schedule_time: Time when this notification needs to be sent to
            the intended recipient.  The notification is not visible to the
            intended recipient prior to this time.  If not specified, the
            notification is sent as soon as possible.

        :param recipient_timezones: dictionary of time zones of the intended
            recipients for which the schedule time is expected to be in their
            local time.  The key corresponds to the identification of an
            intended recipient, and the value corresponds to time zone of this
            particular recipient.

            When a time zone is defined for a particular recipient, the
            function understands that the schedule time of the notification
            for this recipient has to be converted to the local time of this
            recipient.  The function converts `schedule_time` to UTC, and it
            strips the time zone information to get a local time to which the
            function adds the recipient's time zone.

            For instance, if the specified schedule time is
            `2013-12-20 15:00:00+07` and the time zone `+7` is specified
            for a recipient, the schedule time is assumed to be the local time
            `2013-12-20 08:00:00` for the region, i.e., time zone, of this
            recipient.  The resulting schedule time with time zone for this
            recipient is then `2013-12-20 08:00:00+07`
