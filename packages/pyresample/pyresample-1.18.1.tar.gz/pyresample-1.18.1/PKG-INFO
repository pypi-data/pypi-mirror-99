        Pyresample
        ----------
        
        Pyresample is a python package for resampling geospatial image data. It is the
        primary method for resampling in the [Satpy](https://github.com/pytroll/satpy)
        library, but can also be used as a standalone library. Resampling or
        reprojection is the process of mapping input geolocated data points to a
        new target geographic projection and area.
        
        Pyresample can operate on both fixed grids of data and geolocated swath data.
        To describe these data Pyresample uses various "geometry" objects including
        the `AreaDefinition` and `SwathDefinition` classes.
        
        Pyresample offers multiple resampling algorithms including:
        
        - Nearest Neighbor
        - Elliptical Weighted Average (EWA)
        - Bilinear
        
        For nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation pyresample uses a kd-tree
        approach by using the fast KDTree implementation provided by the 
        [pykdtree](https://github.com/storpipfugl/pykdtree) library.
        Pyresample works with numpy arrays and numpy masked arrays. Interfaces to
        XArray objects (including dask array support) are provided in separate
        Resampler class interfaces and are in active development.
        Utility functions are available to easily plot data using Cartopy.
        
        Pyresample is tested with Python 2.7 and 3.6, but should additionally work
        on Python 3.4+. Pyresample will drop Python 2.7 at the end of 2019.
