<h2>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this Objective we will design a user interface to allow users to conveniently
and securely indicate which folders on some devices should be “magically” linked
to which folders on other devices.</p>
<p>This is a critical usability and security issue for which there is no known perfect
solution, but which we believe is amenable to a “good enough” trade-off solution.
This document explains the design and justifies its trade-offs in terms of security,
usability, and time-to-market.</p>

<div class="section" id="design-constraints">
<h2>Design Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#design-constraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The design of the Tahoe-side representation of a Magic Folder, and the
polling mechanism that the Magic Folder clients will use to detect remote
changes was discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="remote-to-local-sync.html"><span class="doc">remote-to-local-sync</span></a>,
and we will not revisit that here. The assumption made by that design was
that each client would be configured with the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a write cap to its own <em>client DMD</em>.</li>
<li>a read cap to a <em>collective directory</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The collective directory contains links to each client DMD named by the
corresponding client’s nickname.</p>
<p>This design was chosen to allow straightforward addition of clients without
requiring each existing client to change its configuration.</p>
<p>Note that each client in a Magic Folder collective has the authority to add,
modify or delete any object within the Magic Folder. It is also able to control
to some extent whether its writes will be treated by another client as overwrites
or as conflicts. However, there is still a reliability benefit to preventing a
client from accidentally modifying another client’s DMD, or from accidentally
modifying the collective directory in a way that would lose data. This motivates
ensuring that each client only has access to the caps above, rather than, say,
every client having a write cap to the collective directory.</p>
<p>Another important design constraint is that we cannot violate the <a class="reference internal" href="../../write_coordination.html"><span class="doc">write
coordination directive</span></a>; that is, we cannot write to
the same mutable directory from multiple clients, even during the setup phase
when adding a client.</p>
<p>Within these constraints, for usability we want to minimize the number of steps
required to configure a Magic Folder collective.</p>

<h2>Proposed Design<a class="headerlink" href="#proposed-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Three <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tahoe</span></code> subcommands are added:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>tahoe magic-folder create MAGIC: [MY_NICKNAME LOCAL_DIR]

  Create an empty Magic Folder. The MAGIC: local alias is set
  to a write cap which can be used to refer to this Magic Folder
  in future ``tahoe magic-folder invite`` commands.

  If MY_NICKNAME and LOCAL_DIR are given, the current client
  immediately joins the newly created Magic Folder with that
  nickname and local directory.


tahoe magic-folder invite MAGIC: THEIR_NICKNAME

  Print an &quot;invitation&quot; that can be used to invite another
  client to join a Magic Folder, with the given nickname.

  The invitation must be sent to the user of the other client
  over a secure channel (e.g. PGP email, OTR, or ssh).

  This command will normally be run by the same client that
  created the Magic Folder. However, it may be run by a
  different client if the ``MAGIC:`` alias is copied to
  the ``private/aliases`` file of that other client, or if
  ``MAGIC:`` is replaced by the write cap to which it points.


tahoe magic-folder join INVITATION LOCAL_DIR

  Accept an invitation created by ``tahoe magic-folder invite``.
  The current client joins the specified Magic Folder, which will
  appear in the local filesystem at the given directory.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are no commands to remove a client or to revoke an
invitation, although those are possible features that could
be added in future. (When removing a client, it is necessary
to copy each file it added to some other client’s DMD, if it
is the most recent version of that file.)</p>

<div class="section" id="discussion">
<h2>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The proposed design has a minor violation of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.eros-os.org/papers/secnotsep.pdf">Principle of Least Authority</a> in order to reduce the number
of steps needed. The invoker of “<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tahoe</span> <span class="pre">magic-folder</span> <span class="pre">invite</span></code>”
creates the client DMD on behalf of the invited client, and
could retain its write cap (which is part of the invitation).</p>
<p>A possible alternative design would be for the invited client
to create its own client DMD, and send it back to the inviter
to be linked into the collective directory. However this would
require another secure communication and another command
invocation per client. Given that, as mentioned earlier, each
client in a Magic Folder collective already has the authority
to add, modify or delete any object within the Magic Folder,
we considered the potential security/reliability improvement
here not to be worth the loss of usability.</p>
<p>We also considered a design where each client had write access to
the collective directory. This would arguably be a more serious
violation of the Principle of Least Authority than the one above
(because all clients would have excess authority rather than just
the inviter). In any case, it was not clear how to make such a
design satisfy the <a class="reference internal" href="../../write_coordination.html"><span class="doc">write coordination
directive</span></a>, because the collective
directory would have needed to be written to by multiple clients.</p>
<p>The reliance on a secure channel to send the invitation to its
intended recipient is not ideal, since it may involve additional
software such as clients for PGP, OTR, ssh etc. However, we believe
that this complexity is necessary rather than incidental, because
there must be some way to distinguish the intended recipient from
potential attackers who would try to become members of the Magic
Folder collective without authorization. By making use of existing
channels that have likely already been set up by security-conscious
users, we avoid reinventing the wheel or imposing substantial extra
implementation costs.</p>
<p>The length of an invitation will be approximately the combined
length of a Tahoe-LAFS read cap and write cap. This is several
lines long, but still short enough to be cut-and-pasted successfully
if care is taken. Errors in copying the invitation can be detected
since Tahoe-LAFS cap URIs are self-authenticating.</p>
<p>The implementation of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tahoe</span></code> subcommands is straightforward
and raises no further difficult design issues.</p>
