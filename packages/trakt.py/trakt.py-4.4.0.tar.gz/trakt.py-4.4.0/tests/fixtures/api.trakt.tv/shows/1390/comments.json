        "comment": "Season 1 was interesting, season 2 was awful, season 3 was not really bad at all.  If I would have watched season 2 before season 3, I would have stopped around episode 4 and never watched this show again.  Thank the writers for Khaleesi, she's the only reason I continue to watch at this point.\r\n\r\nSo many plot holes, such horrible writing, boring drama, action is only near the end of each episode as to manufacture a cliff hanger.  And the biggest issue I have is the complete ignorance to time.  How long does it take to walk, compared to riding, etc?  I have 3 seasons of Gotham coming up next, but getting through the next 3 seasons of GOT my be impossible. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend this show.",

        "comment": "I can tell you that Game of Thrones is phenomenal, staggering, surprising, beautiful, emotional, action-packed and thrilling rollercoaster. Prior to watching the shows I read all the books published till that time. Books&gt;show. However, the show is superb, as the characters are so dramatic and complicated that we may love some but we love to hate some (e.a. Cersei). HUGE plot twists and turns that make the show so amazing. Literally, it is a game for the throne. More families that you can count t fight over the land of Westeros for ascending that throne. Save for the northern families, that desire their own homes and families. Furthermore, the plot doesn't end there. In the far north. a legendary military order, the Night's Watch is dedicated to defending the kingdoms from threats north of the Wall, a sctructure 700ft high. Watch it and you will be rewarded. \r\n\r\n10/10, and Winter is Coming.",

        "comment": "This is a really great show overall tbh. Season 6 managed to get me to really like Jon and Cersei (my former most hated character) in just 2 episodes. Some people say GoT is character driven but i really have to disagree. GoT has somewhat weak characters and is interesting because of the events that happen in the story, not because of the characters who cause them. Some of D&amp;D's decisions have the opposite effect on viewers that they're supposed to have (like trying to make people think Jon is charging forward towards Ramsay out of blind rage when we know that he sees arrows being shot at him and therefore come to the conclusion that he's trying to avoid them, trying to make the viewers fear Jon for justifiably beating the everloving shit out of his half-sister's rapist and half-brother's murderer, etc. I'm told OITNB makes similar decisions.) and the Tumblr fem fanservice (women being accepted into positions of power without any backlash in an extremely misogynistic society, le jaden smith squint *I wil rool...*\" dragon mom herself, etc.) can be cringey but it still has good enough writing and action to appeal to its male viewers. I'd give it an 8 because of some of the decisions made in seasons 5 and 6 but I'm bumping it up to a 9 because of bastardbowl and some scenes in earlier seasons that I really enjoyed.",
