Because of its fast pace the TV series is not as nerve-grating as the books are: here one's empathy with the protagonists that suffer and die is short lived because the plot is moving forward very fast while when reading the books one suffers endlessly when George R. R. Martin decides to kill off (yet) another of the good guys he built up painstakingly or when he lets the evil ones live and flourish even though moral dictates that they have to suffer or die.",
