Introduction
============

This package features two main online sources of data:
    - The official f1 data stream ->
      `f1-live <https://www.formula1.com/en/f1-live.html>`_
    - Ergast web api -> `ergast.com <http://ergast.com/mrd/>`_

Car position, speed traces, tyres, timings and weekend history are some
of the many available resources. No formula1 account is needed.

The library is designed to be interfaced with matplotlib (although you
can use whatever you want) but there is a neat :mod:`fastf1.plotting` module which
you can use to create nice graphs more easily.

Modules handle big chunks of data (~50-100mb per session) so most of the
information is stored locally as cached requests (be aware).

Have fun!

This module was originally developed by Ax6.

This fork is maintained by theOehrly.
I'm very grateful for all the work that was done previously by Ax6!

Getting started
===============

Setting up a running snippet is straightforward::

    import fastf1 as ff1

    ff1.Cache.enable_cache('path/to/folder/for/cache')  # optional but highly recommended

    monza_quali = ff1.get_session(2019, 'Monza', 'Q')

    vettel = monza_quali.get_driver('VET')
    print(f"Pronto {vettel.name}?")
    # Pronto SeüÖ±Ô∏èastian?

For some more advanced stuff, just a few more steps::

    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    from fastf1 import plotting

    plotting.setup_mpl()

    laps = monza_quali.load_laps(with_telemetry=True)
    fast_leclerc = laps.pick_driver('LEC').pick_fastest()
    lec_car_data = fast_leclerc.get_car_data()
    t = lec_car_data['Time']
    vCar = lec_car_data['Speed']

    # The rest is just plotting
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(t, vCar, label='Fast')
    ax.set_xlabel('Time')
    ax.set_ylabel('Speed [Km/h]')
    ax.set_title('Leclerc is')
    ax.legend()
    plt.show()

It is not necessary to enable the usage of the cache but it is highly recommended. Simply provide
the path to some empty folder on your system. Using the cache will greatly speed up loading of the data.
