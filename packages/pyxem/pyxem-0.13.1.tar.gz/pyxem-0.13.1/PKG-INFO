        pyxem is an open-source python library for multi-dimensional diffraction microscopy.
        
        The package defines objects and functions for the analysis of numerous diffraction patterns. It has been primarily developed as a platform for hybrid diffraction-microscopy based on 4D scanning diffraction microscopy data in which a 2D diffraction pattern is recorded at every position in a 2D scan of a specimen.
        
        pyxem is an extension of the hyperspy library for multi-dimensional data analysis and defines diffraction specific `Signal` classes.
        
        **Installation instructions and tutorial examples are available** `here <https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem-demos>`__ .
        
        If analysis using pyxem forms a part of published work please cite the DOI at the top of this page.
        
        pyxem is released under the GPL v3 license.
