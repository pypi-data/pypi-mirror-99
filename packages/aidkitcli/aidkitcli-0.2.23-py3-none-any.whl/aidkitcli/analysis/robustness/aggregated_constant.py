    Execute an Aggregated Constant Corruption and return a plot showing the
    performance of the model on the corrupted data.

    This corruption is an aggregated version of the constant corruption, i.e.
    the values of the selected variable are set to different constant values
    starting with start_constant and equally distributed till end_constant
    while the resulting average absolute errors of the model are tracked.

    This corruption can only be applied to quantitative input variables. The
    supported ML models are:
        - Keras regression recurrent models
        - Keras classification feedforward models
        - scikit-learn classification feedforward models

    :param start_constant: first value the chosen variable is set to
    :param end_constant: maximal corruption value that should not be surpassed
    :param start_index: data points before this index will not be perturbed
