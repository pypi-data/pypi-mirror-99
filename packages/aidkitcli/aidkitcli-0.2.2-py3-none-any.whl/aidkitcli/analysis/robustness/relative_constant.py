    Execute a Relative Constant Corruption and return a plot showing the
    performance of the model on the corrupted data.

    The values of the selected variable are increased or decreased by a
    constant value relative_constant.

    This corruption can only be applied to quantitative input variables. The
    supported ML models are:
        - Keras regression recurrent models
        - Keras classification feedforward models
        - scikit-learn classification feedforward models
