# PV_ICE: PV in the Circular Economy, Dynamic Energy and Materials TOOL

This open-source tool implements Circular Economy metrics for photovoltaic (PV) materials. It can be used to quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reuse, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases in the PV value chain.

The PV_ICE is leveraging published data from different sources on PV manufacturing and predicted technological changes. Input data is being compiled [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV54lNAdA2uP6a0g5wMOOE9bu8nbwvnQDgLj3GuGojE/edit?usp=sharing)

This tool will help implement circularity metrics, quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reusage, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases on PV.


Documentation
=============

The calculator follows the following diagram for calculating Mass Flow. Baseline inputs are available in the PV_ICE \ baselines folder for US and World past and projected values. Full documentation can be found at [readthedocs](http://CircularEconomy-MassFlowCalculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[Input data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV54lNAdA2uP6a0g5wMOOE9bu8nbwvnQDgLj3GuGojE/edit?usp=sharing) references include:

Real world installation data from IEA-PVPS reports for 1995 - 2010 (K. Bolcar and K. Ardani, “National Survey Report of PV Power Applications in the United States 2010,” IEA-PVPS, National Survey T1-19:2010, 2010. [Online]. Available: https://iea-pvps.org/national-survey-reports/.)

Projection installation data 2010-2019 from Q4 2019 Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables/SEIA U.S. Solar Market Insight (A. Perea et al., “U.S. Solar Market Insight: Q4 2019,” SEIA, Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Dec. 2019.)

Installations projected to increase 8.9% compound annual growth rate through 2050 (IRENA, “Future of Solar PV 2019,” IRENA, 2019. Accessed: Apr. 02, 2020. [Online]. Available: https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2019/Nov/IRENA_Future_of_Solar_PV_2019.pdf.)

Degradation rate (in percentage power loss per year) (D. C. Jordan, S. R. Kurtz, K. VanSant, and J. Newmiller, “Compendium of photovoltaic degradation rates,” Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, vol. 24, no. 7, pp. 978–989, 2016, doi: 10.1002/pip.2744.)

Glass thickness data (ITRPV, “International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) 2019,” ITRPV, 10th, Oct. 2019.)

Reliability data, i.e. T50 and T90 lifetime in years (D. C. Jordan, B. Marion, C. Deline, T. Barnes, and M. Bolinger, “PV field reliability status—Analysis of 100 000 solar systems,” Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications, vol. n/a, no. n/a, Feb. 2020, doi: 10.1002/pip.3262.)

All manufacturing, recyling, collection efficiencies currently estimates with real world data pending.


Installation
