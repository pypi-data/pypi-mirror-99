           <BR><BR>[0001] This application is related to and claims the benefit and priority
         of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 62/097,644, titled "Drilling
         Direct Control System" and filed Dec. 30, 2014, and non-provisional U.S.
         patent application Ser. No. 14/627,581, titled "Drilling Direct Control
         User Interface" and filed Feb. 20, 2015, of which this application is a
         continuation-in-part, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
           <BR><BR>FIELD OF INVENTION
    <BR><BR>[0002] Embodiments of the invention relate to hydrocarbon well drilling
         and, more specifically, to systems, computer-readable media, interfaces,
         and methods to control directional drilling.
    <BR><BR>BACKGROUND
    <BR><BR>[0003] In the field of oil and gas exploration and production, hydrocarbon
         wells may be drilled to recover hydrocarbons from subterranean
         formations. Such wells may be constructed by drilling a borehole into a
         formation using a rotary drill bit attached to a remote end of a drill
         string. A fluid that may be referred to as "drilling mud" may be
         circulated down through the drill string to lubricate the drill bit and
         carry drill cuttings out of the wellbore as the fluid returns to the
         surface at the well site. The particular methods and equipment used to
         construct a particular well may vary extensively based on the environment
         and formation in which the well is being drilled. Many different types of
         equipment and systems may be used in the construction of wells,
         including, but not limited to, a rotating system for turning the drill
         bit, a hoisting system for lifting the drill string, a circulating system
         for managing the drilling fluid, pressure management equipment for
         controlling wellbore pressure, a directional drilling and steering system
         for non-vertical drilling, and several downhole tools.
    <BR><BR>[0004] Some oil and gas wells may not be drilled vertically straight but
         rather at a deviated angle from vertical and in a specified direction.
         Specific drilling methods may be deployed to deviate these wells to
         direct them in the desired well path. Such methods, known collectively as
         "directional drilling," may require drilling personnel to orient downhole
         equipment to drill the well in the desired well path. The overall
         directional drilling operation may be directed by a specific person known
         as the "directional driller."
    <BR><BR>[0005] "Sliding" may describe drilling with a mud motor rotating the bit
         downhole without rotating the drill string from the surface. This
         operation may be conducted when a bottom hole assembly has been fitted
         with a bent sub or a bent housing mud motor, or both, for directional
         drilling. Sliding may be a predominant method to build and control or
         correct hole angle in modern and conventional directional drilling
         operations.
    <BR><BR>[0006] A precise drill bit direction may be essential to drilling a
         borehole successfully, particularly in controlled steering and
         directional drilling. Achieving a precise drill bit direction may be
         obtained either by steering while sliding, which orients the bent segment
         of a downhole mud motor from the surface, or by steering while rotating,
         which utilizes a downhole rotary steerable system (RSS).
    <BR><BR>[0007] A drill bit direction may be determined by a toolface orientation
         in three-dimensional space. Downhole toolface orientation is a complex
         function of several drilling variables including, but not limited to,
         weight on bit (WOB), torque on bit (TOB), drill bit torsional speed
         (rotations per minute or RPM), mud motor differential pressure, rate of
         penetration (ROP), drill bit type, formation lithology, and the angular
         position of a rotating system. The overall efficiency of directional
         drilling, especially in the slide drilling, may depend on analyzing all
         of these variables and accordingly applying torque or angle corrections
         to the drill bit.
    <BR><BR>[0008] Current directional drilling practices may require the directional
         driller to verbally translate desired downhole equipment orientation to
         the rig's "driller," a person who may control the machinery on a rig
         floor that is used to drill the well. The driller then may apply and
         maintain the required settings of drilling machinery located on the
         drilling rig floor. These directional drilling methods may result in
         human error that consequentially may increase rig non-productive time,
         lower drilling efficiency, and drive up overall directional drilling
         cost.
    <BR><BR>SUMMARY
    <BR><BR>[0009] Applicant has recognized problems associated with drill bit
         direction in directional drilling and advantageously provides solutions
         to these problems in fields such as drilling control and automation
         systems. Applicant has recognized that, in the presence of latency or a
         delay in receiving toolface orientation information, a controlled
         steering process can lead to undesirable back-and-forth wandering of the
         drill bit, which can result in high trajectory tortuosity. Further,
         Applicant has recognized that substantially online transmission of
         downhole data while drilling can provide new and unique opportunities for
         automated drilling operations by eliminating or dramatically reducing the
         communication delay between downhole and the surface. Wired drill pipe
         technology, for example, can enable such data transmission. This online
         data transmission can enable real-time monitoring, optimization, and
         autonomous direct control solutions and systems for three-dimensional
         directional drilling. Applicant advantageously has recognized a need in
         the art for methods, systems, and apparatuses that can provide these
         capabilities.
    <BR><BR>[0010] Further, a measure of efficiency in a drilling operation can
         include how fast a borehole can be drilled, which is directly related to
         rate of penetration (ROP). An optimal ROP can be a function of several
         drilling variables including, but not limited to, weight on bit (WOB),
         torque on bit (TOB), drill bit torsional speed (rotations per minute or
         RPM), drilling fluid hydraulics, toolface orientation, drill bit type,
         and formation lithology. Increasing ROP can decrease the life of the
         drill bit, which in turn can increase drilling time because shorter drill
         bit life can necessitate more frequent replacements of the drill bit. An
         inappropriate ROP also can lead to such issues as vibration and sticking
         that can eventually slow down the drilling process. Applicant therefore
         has recognized that an autonomous directional drilling solution can
         optimize ROP while steering.
    <BR><BR>[0011] Applicant advantageously provides systems, methods,
         computer-readable media, interfaces, and apparatuses for drilling control
         and automation systems. More specifically, embodiments of systems,
         methods, computer-readable media, interfaces, and apparatuses for
         autonomous, closed-loop directional drilling that can interface with a
         plurality of drilling sensors and communication systems to support a
         variety of autonomous real-time direct control functions using a common
         operation infrastructure are provided. The common operation
         infrastructure can be configured to acquire data from a variety of
         sources and sensors, communicate that data with a variety of control
         functions and information interfaces, and provide substantially online
         operating instructions to drilling equipment and systems, all in real
         time and at a high data rate, which can be enabled by wired drill pipe
         and a surface data network, for example. Embodiments thus can enable an
         operator (or another application) to determine slide drilling with a
         preselected target downhole TOB (DTOB) and/or downhole WOB (DWOB) and
         under a specific toolface orientation.
    <BR><BR>[0012] Directional drilling conceptually can include orienting the bit in
         the desired direction and executing a series of slide drill and rotate
         drill iterations. Orienting can be accomplished by rotating and holding
         the axial position of the drill string so that the bent sub or bent
         housing, which has a small angle offset, orients the new direction in
         which to drill. Without turning the drill string, the bit can be rotated
         with a mud motor and drill in the direction it points. With steerable
         motors, when the desired wellbore direction is attained, the entire drill
         string can be rotated and drill straight rather than at an angle. By
         controlling the amount of hole drilled in the sliding versus the rotating
         mode, the wellbore trajectory can be controlled precisely.
    <BR><BR>[0013] Advantages of embodiments of the invention can include that a
         feedback control can obtain direct data at downhole. Because of this, the
         control can take into account unforeseen disturbances due to, for
         example, frictional, hydraulic, and lithology changes. By altering one or
         more surface drilling parameters immediately once deviations are observed
         in toolface orientation and downhole TOB, regardless of what caused the
         deviation, embodiments can deliver slide drilling with higher accuracy
         and stability.
    <BR><BR>[0014] For example, embodiments can include systems and methods to control
         directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon wells. A system
         according to an embodiment can include, for example, a drill string
         positioned within a borehole for a hydrocarbon well. The borehole can
         extend from a surface into subterranean material. Further, a drill string
         can include one or more substantially cylindrical segments of drill pipe,
         a wire drilling line, a bottom hole assembly, a drill bit, and a downhole
         drive controller to control rotation of the drill bit. A system also can
         include a top drive positioned substantially at the surface and connected
         to the drill string. Operation of the top drive can rotate the drill
         string within the borehole. Additionally, a system can include a
         drawworks positioned substantially at the surface and connected to the
         drill string. The drawworks can include a substantially cylindrical spool
         around which the wire drilling line is wound, and the drawworks also can
         include a pulley and a brake to inhibit unwinding of the wire drilling
         line from the spool. Further, operation of the drawworks can rotate the
         spool thereby to extend the wire drilling line into the borehole and
         alternatively to retract the wire drilling line from the borehole. As a
         result, operation of the drawworks thereby can lower the drill string
         into the borehole and alternatively can reel the drill string in from the
         borehole. A system still further can include a mud pump positioned
         substantially at the surface and connected to the drill string. Operation
         of the mud pump can pump a drilling fluid through the one or more
         segments of drill pipe and the bottom hole assembly of the drill string
         to the drill bit. In addition, a system can include a first set of one or
         more sensors positioned along the drill string thereby defining one or
         more downhole sensors. A system also can include a second set of one or
         more sensors positioned at the surface thereby defining one or more
         surface sensors.
    <BR><BR>[0015] Additionally, a system according to an embodiment can include a
         controller. A controller can include one or more processors positioned at
         the surface and in communication with the downhole drive controller, the
         top drive, the drawworks, the mud pump, the one or more downhole sensors,
         and the one or more surface sensors. Further, the controller can be in
         communication with the downhole drive controller and the one or more
         downhole sensors through the one or more segments of drill pipe. A system
         also can include a non-transitory computer-readable medium in
         communication with the one or more processors of the controller. The
         non-transitory computer-readable medium can have one or more computer
         programs stored thereon that, when executed by the one or more
         processors, cause the system to perform certain actions. For example, a
         system can determine one or more of a target downhole torque on bit
         (DTOB) measurement value and a target downhole weight on bit (DWOB)
         measurement value responsive to receipt of user input from a user
         computing device in communication with the controller. A system also can
         determine a target toolface orientation measurement value responsive to
         receipt of the user input from the user computing device. In addition, a
         system can determine, responsive to one or more measurements at the one
         or more downhole sensors, an actual toolface orientation measurement
         value and one or more of an actual DTOB measurement value and an actual
         DWOB measurement value. A system further can determine, responsive to one
         or more measurements at the one or more surface sensors, a current top
         drive operation measurement value, a current drawworks operation
         measurement value, and a current mud pump operation value. Additionally,
         a system can determine one or more error values selected from a group of
         a DTOB error value and a DWOB error value. A DTOB error value can be
         determined responsive to a comparison of the target DTOB measurement
         value to the actual DTOB measurement value, and a DWOB error value can be
         determined responsive to a comparison of the target DWOB measurement
         value to the actual DWOB measurement value. Still further, a system can
         determine, responsive to a comparison of the target toolface orientation
         measurement value and the actual toolface orientation measurement value,
         a toolface orientation error value. A system also can determine a control
         command for one or more of the top drive, the drawworks, and the mud pump
         to correct each of the toolface orientation error value and the one or
         more of the DTOB error value and the DWOB error value responsive to the
         current top drive operation measurement value, the current drawworks
         operation measurement value, and the current mud pump operation value. In
         addition, a system can operate one or more of the top drive, the
         drawworks, and the mud pump responsive to the control command thereby to
         correct a toolface orientation of the drill string. Operation of the
         drawworks can include altering a weight on bit measurement value at the
         surface. Further, operation of the top drive can include altering one or
         more of an angle of the drill string with respect to the surface and a
         rotational speed of the drill string within the borehole. Operation of
         the mud pump can include altering a flow rate measurement value of the
         drilling fluid at the surface.
    <BR><BR>[0016] In some instances, determining the actual toolface measurement
         value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the
         actual DWOB measurement value can include validating the one or more
         measurements at the one or more downhole sensors thereby to produce one
         or more validated measurements, as well as filtering the one or more
         validated measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered
         measurements. Further, determining the actual toolface measurement value
         and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual
         DWOB measurement value can include reconciling the one or more filtered
         measurements thereby to produce one or more reconciled measurements and
         verifying the one or more reconciled measurements thereby to produce one
         or more verified measurements. Determining the actual toolface
         measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement
         value and the actual DWOB measurement value also can include remediating
         gross errors in the one or more verified measurements thereby to produce
         the actual toolface measurement value and the one or more of the actual
         DTOB measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement value.
         Additionally, in some circumstances, the control command can be
         responsive to one or more dynamic models of the drill string within the
         borehole. Further, operation of the drawworks can control a rate of
         penetration of the drill string. In addition, in some instances, the one
         or more computer programs, when executed by the one or more processors,
         can cause the system to estimate one or more future values of one or more
         downhole variables and to determine an optimal rate of penetration of the
         drill string responsive to a constrained optimization problem. The
         control command can be responsive to the determined optimal rate of
         penetration of the drill string.
    <BR><BR>[0017] Additionally, the control command can be for each of the top drive
         and the drawworks. In some circumstances, determining the control command
         can include using multi-input, multi-output control logic to determine
         the control command. Further, the multi-input, multi-output control logic
         can include a plurality of decision rules, and each of the decision rules
         can be associated with one or more of: drawworks control, top drive
         control, and mud pump control. In other circumstances, determining the
         control command can include using a first single-input, single-output
         control logic to determine the control command for the top drive and a
         second single-input, single-output control logic to determine the control
         command for the drawworks.
    <BR><BR>[0018] Another system according to an embodiment can include a controller,
         which can include one or more processors. Such a system also can include
         a non-transitory computer-readable medium in communication with the one
         or more processors of the controller. The non-transitory
         computer-readable medium can have one or more computer programs stored
         thereon that, when executed by the one or more processors, can cause the
         system to perform certain actions. For example, a system can determine an
         actual downhole torque on bit (DTOB) measurement value and an actual
         toolface orientation measurement value for a drill string positioned in a
         borehole for a hydrocarbon well. A system also can determine, responsive
         to a comparison of a target DTOB measurement value and the actual DTOB
         measurement value, a DTOB error value. Further, a system can determine,
         responsive to a comparison of a target toolface orientation measurement
         value and the actual toolface orientation measurement value, a toolface
         orientation error value. A system still further can determine a control
         command for one or more of a top drive and a drawworks responsive to the
         DTOB error value and the toolface orientation error value. Additionally,
         a system can operate one or more of the top drive and the drawworks
         responsive to the control command thereby to correct a toolface
         orientation of the drill string.
    <BR><BR>[0019] In some instances, determining the actual DTOB measurement value
         can include determining an actual downhole weight on bit (DWOB)
         measurement value. Additionally, determining the actual DTOB measurement
         value and the actual toolface orientation measurement value can be
         responsive to one or more of: (a) a Kalman filter and (b) one or more
         measurements at one or more sensors positioned within the borehole.
         Further, the controller can be in communication with one or more sensors
         positioned within the borehole through one or more segments of wired
         drill pipe. The one or more computer programs, when executed by the one
         or more processors, further can cause the system to determine a current
         top drive operation measurement value and a current drawworks operation
         measurement value. Additionally, the control command can be responsive to
         the current top drive operation measurement value and the current
         drawworks operation measurement value. Further, the control command can
         be for one or more of the top drive, the drawworks, and a mud pump, and
         the one or more computer programs, when executed by the one or more
         processors, further can cause the system to determine a current mud pump
         operation measurement value and to operate the mud pump responsive to the
         control command thereby to correct a toolface orientation of the drill
         string. In some circumstances, determining the actual DTOB measurement
         value and the actual toolface measurement value can include validating
         the one or more measurements at the one or more sensors thereby to
         produce one or more validated measurements and filtering the one or more
         validated measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered
         measurements. Further, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and
         the actual toolface measurement value can include reconciling the one or
         more filtered measurements thereby to produce one or more reconciled
         measurements and verifying the one or more reconciled measurements
         thereby to produce one or more verified measurements. In addition,
         determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface
         measurement value can include remediating gross errors in the one or more
         verified measurements thereby to produce the actual DTOB measurement
         value and the actual toolface measurement value.
    <BR><BR>[0020] In addition, operation of the drawworks can include altering a
         weight on bit (WOB) measurement value at a surface of the borehole, and
         operation of the top drive can include altering one or more of an angle
         of the drill string with respect to the surface and a rotational speed of
         the drill string within the borehole. Further, the one or more computer
         programs, when executed by the one or more processors, also can cause the
         system to determine the target DTOB measurement value responsive to
         receipt of user input from a user computing device in communication with
         the controller. The user input can include one or more of: a preselected
         DTOB measurement value, a preselected rate of penetration, a preselected
         downhole WOB, and a preselected mud motor differential pressure. The one
         or more computer programs, when executed by the one or more processors,
         also can cause the system to determine the target toolface orientation
         measurement value responsive to receipt of the user input from the user
         computing device. Still further, the control command can be responsive to
         one or more dynamic models of the drill string within the borehole, and
         operation of the drawworks can control a rate of penetration of the drill
         string. The one or more computer programs, when executed by the one or
         more processors, can cause the system to estimate one or more future
         values of one or more downhole variables and to determine an optimal rate
         of penetration of the drill string responsive to a constrained
         optimization problem. Additionally, the control command can be responsive
         to the determined optimal rate of penetration of the drill string.
    <BR><BR>[0021] In addition to systems, embodiments of the invention can include
         methods to control directional drilling in borehole drilling for
         hydrocarbon wells. A method according to an embodiment can include, for
         example, determining an actual downhole torque on bit (DTOB) measurement
         value and an actual toolface orientation measurement value for a drill
         string positioned in a borehole for a hydrocarbon well. A method also can
         include determining, responsive to a comparison of a target DTOB
         measurement value and the actual DTOB measurement value, a DTOB error
         value. Further, a method can include determining, responsive to a
         comparison of a target toolface orientation measurement value and the
         actual toolface orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation
         error value. A method additionally can include determining a control
         command for one or more of a top drive and a drawworks responsive to the
         DTOB error value and the toolface orientation error value. Still further,
         a method can include operating one or more of the top drive and the
         drawworks responsive to the control command thereby to correct a toolface
         orientation of the drill string.
    <BR><BR>[0022] In some instances, determining the actual DTOB measurement value
         can include determining an actual downhole weight on bit (DWOB)
         measurement value. Further, determining the actual DTOB measurement value
         and the actual toolface orientation measurement value can be responsive
         to one or more of: (a) a Kalman filter and (b) one or more measurements
         at one or more sensors positioned within the borehole. Additionally, a
         method further can include receiving the one or more measurements from
         one or more sensors positioned within the borehole through one or more
         segments of wired drill pipe and determining a current top drive
         operation measurement value and a current drawworks operation measurement
         value. The control command also can be responsive to the current top
         drive operation measurement value and the current drawworks operation
         measurement value. Further, the control command can be for one or more of
         the top drive, the drawworks, and a mud pump, and the method also can
         include determining a current mud pump operation measurement value and
         operating the mud pump responsive to the control command thereby to
         correct a toolface orientation of the drill string. In some
         circumstances, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the
         actual toolface measurement value can include validating the one or more
         measurements at the one or more sensors thereby to produce one or more
         validated measurements, as well as filtering the one or more validated
         measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered measurements.
         Determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface
         measurement value also can include reconciling the one or more filtered
         measurements thereby to produce one or more reconciled measurements and
         verifying the one or more reconciled measurements thereby to produce one
         or more verified measurements. Further, determining the actual DTOB
         measurement value and the actual toolface measurement value can include
         remediating gross errors in the one or more verified measurements thereby
         to produce the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual toolface
         measurement value.
    <BR><BR>[0023] In addition, operation of the drawworks can include altering a
         weight on bit (WOB) measurement value at a surface of the borehole, and
         operation of the top drive can include altering one or more of an angle
         of the drill string with respect to the surface and a rotational speed of
         the drill string within the borehole. A method further can include
         determining the target DTOB measurement value responsive to receipt of
         user input from a user computing device. The user input can include one
         or more of: a preselected DTOB measurement value, a preselected rate of
         penetration, a preselected downhole WOB, and a preselected mud motor
         differential pressure. A method also can include determining the target
         toolface orientation measurement value responsive to receipt of the user
         input from the user computing device. Additionally, the control command
         can be responsive to one or more dynamic models of the drill string
         within the borehole. Further, operation of the drawworks can control a
         rate of penetration of the drill string. A method further can include
         estimating one or more future values of one or more downhole variables
         and determining an optimal rate of penetration of the drill string
         responsive to a constrained optimization problem. The control command
         also can be responsive to the determined optimal rate of penetration of
         the drill string.

    <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    <BR><BR>[0037] So that the manner in which the features and advantages of the
         embodiments of systems, computer-readable media, interfaces, and methods
         of the present invention, as well as others, which will become apparent,
         may be understood in more detail, a more particular description of the
         embodiments of systems, computer-readable media, interfaces, and methods
         of the present invention briefly summarized above may be had by reference
         to the embodiments thereof, which are illustrated in the appended
         drawings, which form a part of this specification. It is to be noted,
         however, that the drawings illustrate only various embodiments of the
         embodiments of systems, computer-readable media, interfaces, and methods
         of the present invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting
         of the embodiments of systems, computer-readable media, interfaces, and
         methods of the present invention's scope as it may include other
         effective embodiments as well.
    <BR><BR>[0038] Systems, methods, and computer-readable media for autonomous direct
         controlled steering in directional drilling can use substantially online
         data transmission (that is, data transmission that can be accomplished
         during drilling) to take drilling parameter measurements at one or more
         downhole locations. Wired drill pipe, for example, can enable online data
         transmission, as can additional or other hardware and signals, as will be
         understood by those skilled in the art. These measurements can be used,
         along with data validation and reconciliation techniques, to produce
         reliable online information from downhole and surface variables in
         real-time intervals. Further, such direct control in autonomous
         directional drilling can be based on joint control of downhole torque on
         bit (DTOB) and toolface orientation while taking into consideration the
         coupling dynamics between torque and angular displacement in slide
         drilling. Additionally, control methods can adaptively predict the impact
         of changing downhole torque on the toolface orientation and can
         compensate accordingly for that impact in advance before it can influence
         the toolface angular displacement. In some instances, a closed-loop
         control of directional drilling can include a first set of control
         operations that ensure stability and robustness of automated directional
         drilling against a wide range of external disturbances, measurement
         errors, and unknown lithology and hydraulic conditions. Such a first set
         of control operations can be implemented fully either in a downhole
         device or in a surface application. Further, such a first set of control
         operations can be executed by a controller to issue operating commands to
         a drilling equipment system (including, for example, one or more of a
         rotating system, a hoisting system, a circulating system, and a downhole
         rotary steerable system (RSS)) that can either directly or indirectly
         affect one or more drilling parameters. Additionally, in some
         circumstances, a closed-loop control of directional drilling also can
         include a second set of control operations that can evaluate the drilling
         operating conditions and adaptively modify the first set of control
         operations thereby to alter the manner of issuing operating commands to
         one or more of a rotating system, a hoisting system, a circulating
         system, and a downhole RSS. The second set of control operations can
         include online adjusting the control parameters used as input to the
         first set of control operations, as well as choosing a suitable control
         structure from a database based on one or more if-then scenarios. Still
         further, a closed-loop control of directional drilling also can include a
         third set of control operations that can determine an optimal rate of
         penetration (ROP) online to enhance the overall directional drilling
         performance by estimating short- to mid-term future values of a
         preselected set of downhole variables and by solving a set of parametric
         constrained optimization problems. Each set of control operations can be
         associated with one or more separate controllers or other computing
         devices, or one or more sets of control operations can be associated with
         the same controller or other computing devices.
    <BR><BR>[0039] Embodiments of the invention can include, for example, systems to
         control directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon wells.
         A system 100 according to an embodiment, for instance, can relate to a
         borehole 102 for a hydrocarbon well extending from a surface into
         subterranean material, as illustrated in FIG. 1, for example. Such a
         system 100 can include a drill string 104 positioned within the borehole
         102. A drill string 104 can include one or more substantially cylindrical
         segments of drill pipe 106, a wire drilling line 117, a bottom hole
         assembly (BHA) 108, a drill bit 110, and a downhole drive controller 112
         to control and adjust rotation of the drill bit 110. A downhole drive
         controller 112 can include, for example, a controller associated with the
         RSS. A drill bit 110 can be located at the bottom of the BHA 108, as
         illustrated in FIG. 1, for example. A system 100 further can include a
         top drive 114 or other rotating system positioned substantially at the
         surface and connected to the drill string 104. Operation of the top drive
         114 can rotate the drill string 104 within the borehole 102 along an axis
         substantially parallel to the walls of the borehole 102. Such a top drive
         114 can be a device or assembly made up of one or more components or
         machines (including, for example, one or more motors, one or more gears,
         and a rotary mechanism) that is operable to rotate the drill string 104
         within the borehole 102. In addition, a system 100 can include a
         drawworks 116 or other hoisting system positioned substantially at the
         surface and connected to the drill string 104. The drawworks 116 can
         include a substantially cylindrical spool around which the wire drilling
         line 117 can be wound. Further, the drawworks 116 also can include a
         pulley 119 and a brake to inhibit unwinding of the wire drilling line 117
         from the spool. Operation of the drawworks 116 can rotate the spool
         thereby to extend the wire drilling line 117 into the borehole 102 and,
         alternatively, to retract the wire drilling line 117 from the borehole
         102. That is, operation of the drawworks 116 thereby can lower the drill
         string 104 into the borehole 102 and alternatively can reel the drill
         string 104 in from the borehole 102. Consequently, operation of the
         drawworks 116 can control ROP of the drill string 104. The drawworks 116
         can be a device or assembly made up of one or more components or machines
         (including, for example, the wire drilling line 117, one or more spools,
         one or more pulleys 119, and one or more brakes) that is operable to
         hoist the drill string 104 in and out of the borehole 102. A system 100
         also can include a mud pump 118 or other circulating system positioned
         substantially at the surface and connected to the drill string 104.
         Operation of the mud pump 118 can pump a drilling fluid through the one
         or more segments of drill pipe 106 and the BHA 108 of the drill string
         104 to the drill bit 110. That is, such a mud pump 118 (or another
         circulating system) can pump a drilling fluid down via the drill pipe 106
         where the drilling fluid subsequently can exit the drill string 104 via
         orifices in the drill bit 110 and then flow upwardly to the surface
         through the annulus of the borehole 102, as will be understood by those
         skilled in the art.
    <BR><BR>[0040] The drill bit 110, the downhole drive controller 112, a sensor
         assembly 126, the drill pipe 106, the top drive 114 (or other rotating
         system), the drawworks 116 (or other hoisting system), the mud pump 118
         (or other circulating system), and any other drilling equipment
         (including those not illustrated in the example depicted in FIG. 1) each
         can include one or more high sampling rate drilling parameter sensors.
         For example, a system 100 can include a first set of one or more sensors
         positioned along the drill string 104 thereby defining one or more
         downhole sensors 120 (sometimes called downhole parameter sensors). As
         illustrated, downhole sensors 120 are positioned on or at the BHA 108 but
         can be positioned in other locations, as well, and need not be positioned
         in the locations illustrated in the example depicted in FIG. 1. A system
         100 also can include a second set of one or more sensors positioned at
         the surface thereby defining one or more surface sensors 122. As
         illustrated, surface sensors 122 are rig-mounted sensors and positioned
         at the top drive 114, the drawworks 116, and the mud pump 118, but
         surface sensors 122 can be positioned at other locations, as well, and
         need not be positioned in the locations illustrated in the example
         depicted in FIG. 1. A drilling parameter sensor, such as a downhole
         sensor 120 or a surface sensor 122, can be any sensor operable to measure
         and provide raw data regarding at least one drilling parameter. Such a
         sensor can be mounted to any location available to sense the drilling
         parameter being monitored. Exemplary downhole sensors 120 can include
         (but are not limited to) direction measurement sensors, formation and
         wellbore evaluation sensors, sensors for determining the performance and
         physical condition of the BHA 108 and the drill bit 110, mud motor
         parameter sensors, and sensors for determining the operating condition of
         the drill string 104, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.
         Exemplary surface sensors 122 can include (but are not limited to)
         sensors for measuring variables related to the drill string 104, such as
         load, torque, position, velocity, acceleration, and vibration, as well as
         sensors for measuring the fluid-related variables such as mud pressure,
         mud flow rate, and casing annular pressure and temperature, as will be
         understood by those skilled in the art.
    <BR><BR>[0041] A system 100 also can include a controller 130 positioned at the
         surface. A controller 130 can include one or more processors 132 and can
         be in communication with the downhole drive controller 112, the top drive
         114, the drawworks 116, the mud pump 118, the one or more downhole
         sensors 120, and the one or more surface sensors 122, as illustrated in
         FIG. 5, for example. A downhole communication hub 128 can be operable to
         collect data from different downhole sensors 120 and to transmit the
         collected data to the surface via a substantially online data
         transmission system 124, in some circumstances, as illustrated in FIG. 1,
         for example. The communications hub 128 also can be operable to receive
         operating instructions and control signals from the surface and relay
         those signals to one or more downhole sensors 120, the downhole drive
         controller 112, or other downhole tools. Such a substantially online data
         transmission system 124 can be any system suitable for the continuous
         transmission of measurement data, control commands, and other signals
         between downhole and the surface in real-time intervals of, for example,
         one second. Exemplary communication methods can include, but are not
         limited to, direct communication via electric signals along wired drill
         pipe (such as drill pipe 106), mud-pulse telemetry, fiber optics,
         wireless signals, acoustic signals, and electromagnetic signals. For
         example, a data transmission system 124 can include a wired drill pipe
         106 that in turn includes conductors coupled to the drill pipe 106 to
         provide a direct link between downhole and the surface. For example, in
         some instances, the controller 130 can be in communication with the
         downhole drive controller 112 and the one or more downhole sensors 120
         through the one or more segments of drill pipe 106, for example, as
         illustrated in FIG. 5. The data transmission system 124 can be connected
         to a surface data network (such as a network to which the controller 130
         also is connected) via a surface communications link that can be
         integrated into a component such as a swivel, internal blow out preventer
         (IBOP) or into an instrumented saver sub coupled to the drill string 104.
         Consequently, the controller 130 can be in communication with the data
         transmission system 124, as illustrated in FIG. 1, for example.
    <BR><BR>[0042] A system 100 also can include a non-transitory computer-readable
         medium (such as a memory 136) in communication with the one or more
         processors 132 of the controller 130. The computer-readable medium 136
         can have one or more computer programs stored thereon that, when executed
         by the one or more processors 132, cause the system 100 to perform
         certain steps. For example, the system 100 can receive user input from a
         user, such as a directional driller, before performing additional steps.
         For instance, a system 100 can determine a target downhole torque on bit
         (DTOB) measurement value (that is, a targeted DTOB value to be measured
         by one or more downhole sensors 120) responsive to receipt of user input
         from a user computing device in communication with the controller 130.
         Further, for example, a user such as a directional driller can preselect
         a desired or target DTOB, or a target DTOB can be calculated from or
         otherwise determined based on some other preselected target value, such
         as ROP, WOB, or mud motor differential pressure. As an alternative or in
         addition to determining a target DTOB, a system 100 can determine a
         target downhole WOB (DWOB) measurement value (that is, a targeted DWOB
         value to be measured by one or more downhole sensors 120) responsive to
         receipt of user input from the user computing device. A system 100 also
         can determine a target toolface orientation measurement value (that is, a
         targeted toolface orientation value to be measured by one or more
         downhole sensors 120) responsive to receipt of the user input from the
         user computing device. As an alternative to a directional driller's
         preselection of these target values, any or all of the target values can
         be automatically computed by a drilling path planner, for example, in
         some circumstances.
    <BR><BR>[0043] Further, a system 100 can determine6--responsive to one or more
         measurements at the one or more downhole sensors 120--an actual toolface
         orientation measurement value (that is, an actual toolface orientation
         value as measured by one or more downhole sensors 120) and one or more of
         an actual DTOB measurement value (that is, an actual DTOB value as
         measured by one or more downhole sensors 120) and an actual DWOB
         measurement value (that is, an actual DWOB value as measured by one or
         more downhole sensors 120). For example, when a target DTOB measurement
         value has been determined, a system 100 can determine an actual DTOB
         measurement value; when a target DWOB has been determined, a system 100
         can determine an actual DWOB measurement value. A system 100 also can
         determine--responsive to one or more measurements at the one or more
         surface sensors 122--one or more of a current top drive operation
         measurement value, a current drawworks operation measurement value, and a
         current mud pump operation measurement value.
    <BR><BR>[0044] In addition, a system 100 can determine one or more of a DTOB error
         value and a DWOB error value. For example, when a target DTOB measurement
         value and an actual DTOB measurement value have been determined, a DTOB
         error value can be determined responsive to a comparison of the target
         DTOB measurement value to the actual DTOB measurement value. As an
         alternative to or in addition to determining a DTOB error value, for
         example, a DWOB error value can be determined--responsive to a comparison
         of the target DWOB measurement value to the actual DWOB measurement
         value--when a target DWOB measurement value and an actual DWOB
         measurement value have been determined. For example, the actual DTOB
         measurement value can be compared to the target DTOB measurement value to
         generate one or more of torque position error (E.sub.TOB), torque
         velocity error (.DELTA.E.sub.TOB), and torque acceleration error
         (.DELTA..sup.2E.sub.TOB). Each of these error variables then can be
         scaled using a corresponding, in some instances nonlinear, scale function
         (such as, for example, SE.sub.TOB, S.DELTA.E.sub.TOB, and
         S.DELTA..sup.2E.sub.TOB) that can determine the general sensitivity of
         control logic with respect to different values of the respective error
         variable. Likewise, the actual DWOB measurement value can be compared to
         the target DWOB measurement value to generate one or more of weight
         position error (E.sub.WOB), weight velocity error (.DELTA.E.sub.WOB), and
         weight acceleration error (.DELTA..sup.2E.sub.WOB). Each of these error
         variables then can be scaled using a corresponding, in some instances
         nonlinear, scale function (such as, for example, SE.sub.WOB,
         S.DELTA.E.sub.WOB, and S.DELTA..sup.2E.sub.WOB) that can determine the
         general sensitivity of control logic with respect to different values of
         the respective error variable. Each scale function can be determined
         analytically or using a knowledge-based approach.
    <BR><BR>[0045] In a similar manner, a system 100 can determine, responsive to a
         comparison of the target toolface orientation measurement value and the
         actual toolface orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation
         error value. For example, the actual toolface orientation measurement
         value can be compared to the target toolface orientation measurement
         value to generate one or more of position error E.sub.toolface, velocity
         error .DELTA.E.sub.toolface, and acceleration error
         .DELTA..sup.2E.sub.toolface that then can be scaled using one or more (in
         some instances, nonlinear) scale functions, such as, for example,
         SE.sub.toolface, S.DELTA.E.sub.toolface, and
         S.DELTA..sup.2E.sub.toolface.
    <BR><BR>[0046] A system 100 then can determine a control command for one or more
         of the top drive 114, the drawworks 116, and the mud pump 118 to correct
         each of the toolface orientation error value and the one or more of the
         DTOB error value and the DWOB error value responsive to the one or more
         of the current top drive operation measurement value, the current
         drawworks operation measurement value, and the current mud pump operation
         value, for example. A control command for the top drive 114 can be
         responsive to the current top drive operation measurement value, for
         instance, and a control command for the drawworks 116 can be responsive
         to the current drawworks operation measurement value. A control command
         for the mud pump 118 can be responsive to the current mud pump operation
         measurement value. Further, a system 100 can operate one or more of the
         top drive 114, the drawworks 116, and the mud pump 118 responsive to the
         control command, which can include one or more commands for the
         respective equipment. Operation of the drawworks 116 can include altering
         an ROP, and consequently a WOB, measurement value at the surface.
         Further, operation of the top drive 114 can include altering one or more
         of an angle of the drill string 104 with respect to the surface and a
         rotational speed of the drill string 104 within the borehole 102. In
         addition, operation of the mud pump 118 can include altering a flow rate
         measurement value of the drilling fluid at the surface and, as a result,
         a fluid differential pressure (DiffP) at the surface. Consequently,
         operation of one or more of the top drive 114, the drawworks 116, and the
         mud pump 118 responsive to the control command thereby eventually can
         correct one or more of a toolface orientation of the drill string 104, a
         DTOB, and a DWOB.
    <BR><BR>[0047] A system 100 also can perform data validation and reconciliation
         operations. The raw measurement data obtained by downhole sensors 120 and
         surface sensors 122 may not be fully correct as a result of measurement
         errors. Measurement errors can be categorized into two basic types: (1)
         random errors that can result from intrinsic sensor accuracy and (2)
         gross or systematic errors that can result from sensor calibration or
         faulty data transmission. Data validation and reconciliation operations
         can use filtering and estimation techniques to produce a single
         consistent set of data that represent the most likely value of a drilling
         parameter in real-time intervals of, for example, one second, while the
         raw data measured by the downhole sensors 120 and surface sensors 122 can
         exceed, for example, 50 Hz in sampling rate.
    <BR><BR>[0048] Exemplary data validation and reconciliation operations are
         illustrated, for instance, in FIG. 3. For example, in some circumstances,
         determining the actual toolface measurement value and the one or more of
         the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement value
         can include validating 204 the one or more measurements at the one or
         more downhole sensors 120 (such as high sampling rate raw measurement
         data 202) thereby to produce one or more validated measurements, as
         illustrated in FIG. 3, for example. Validating 204 the one or more
         measurements, which can have been sampled at a high rate, can provide
         certain improvements to the fitness, accuracy, and consistency of the
         measured values. Exemplary validation 204 operations can include, but are
         not limited to, examining data for consistency within a minimum and
         maximum expected range, discarding isolated data that deviate
         significantly from neighboring data measurements, cleaning data from
         spike faults when the rate of change in a gradient of measurement data
         over a specific period of time is much greater than expected, and
         monitoring stuck-at fault or frozen data where a series of measurement
         data remain with little or no variation for a period of time greater than
         expected.
    <BR><BR>[0049] Data validation and reconciliation operations also can include
         filtering 208 the validated data. For example, determining the actual
         toolface measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB
         measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement value also can include
         filtering 208 the one or more validated measurements thereby to produce
         one or more filtered measurements. Filtering 208 the one or more
         validated measurements can attenuate noise components of the measurement
         data. Exemplary filtering 208 methods can include, but are not limited
         to, taking the simple average of measured values over a specific time
         period, taking the moving average based on a specific moving time window,
         taking the exponentially weighted moving average that places greater
         importance on more recent data by discounting older data in an
         exponential manner, using local regression methods, and applying
         Savitzky-Golay filtering.
    <BR><BR>[0050] In addition, data validation and reconciliation operations can
         include reconciling 210 the filtered data. For instance, determining the
         actual toolface measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB
         measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement value further can
         include reconciling 210 the one or more filtered measurements thereby to
         produce one or more reconciled measurements. Reconciling 210 the one or
         more filtered measurements can correct random errors. From a statistical
         viewpoint, a main assumption in data reconciliation can be that no gross
         errors exist in the set of measurements, since gross errors can bias the
         reconciliation results and reduce the robustness of the reconciliation.
         Given n measurements for each variable in a set of m variables, data
         reconciliation can be expressed as an optimization problem of the
         following form:
    <BR><BR>    minimize         f    (  y *  )    =     p = 1  m        i = 1  n
         (    y i p  -  y  p *     .sigma. p   )  2     ##EQU00001##     subject
              to         y min   .ltoreq.  y *  .ltoreq.   y max         and
           F    (  y *  )     = 0  ##EQU00001.2##
    <BR><BR> where f(y*) can be called a measurement penalty function, a can be the
         variance of the random noise, y.sub.min and y.sub.max can be bounds on
         the measured variables, and F(y*)=0 can represent a set of model
         equations 206 that express the general structure of the process as
         functions of reconciled data. Models 206 can have different levels of
         detail. For example, a model 206 can incorporate simple static material
         balances or advanced dynamic models.
    <BR><BR>[0051] Data validation and reconciliation operations also can include
         verifying 212 the reconciled data. For example, determining the actual
         toolface measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB
         measurement value and the actual DWOB measurement value also can include
         verifying 212 the one or more reconciled measurements thereby to produce
         one or more verified measurements. Result verification 212 can include,
         but is not limited to, measurement penalty analysis for determining the
         reliability of the reconciliation and bound checks to ensure that the
         reconciled values lie in a certain reasonable bounds. Result verification
         212 can utilize analytical redundancy-based methods where an analytical
         model 206 is used to provide estimates of measured variables. This
         redundancy then can be used to detect any discrepancy or residual between
         the reconciled data and expected values. The analytical model 206 can be
         mathematical or knowledge-based. Exemplary model-based techniques can
         include, but are not limited to, an observer-based approach, a
         parity-space approach, a parameter identification-based approach, and a
         Kalman filter approach. After result verification 212, data validation
         and reconciliation operations can include determining whether a valid
         result has been produced 214. If a valid result has not been produced at
         step 214, data reconciliation 210 can begin again. If a valid result has
         been produced at step 214, however, data validation and reconciliation
         operations can proceed.
    <BR><BR>[0052] Data validation and reconciliation operations still further can
         include detecting 216 and remediating 220 gross errors in the verified
         data. For example, determining the actual toolface measurement value and
         the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual DWOB
         measurement value can include remediating gross errors 220 in the one or
         more verified measurements thereby to produce the actual toolface
         measurement value and the one or more of the actual DTOB measurement
         value and the actual DWOB measurement value. Gross error detection 216
         can indicate whether a gross error exists somewhere in the set of
         measurements at step 218, for instance. In some circumstances, it can be
         assumed that the measurement errors are normally distributed. Then, if no
         gross errors exist in the set of measurements, each penalty term in f(y*)
         can be a random variable that is normally distributed with a mean equal
         to 0 and a variance equal to 1. By consequence, the measurement penalty
         function f(y*) can be a random variable which follows a chi-square
         distribution, since it is the sum of the square of normally distributed
         random variables. This can lead to an exemplary gross error detection
         approach that can include comparing the value of the objective function
         f(y*) with a given percentile P.sub..alpha. of the probability density
         function of a chi-square distribution that can give an indication of
         whether a gross error exists. In such an example, if
         f(y*).ltoreq.P.sub.90, no gross errors exists with a 90% probability.
         Another exemplary gross error detection approach can include an
         individual test that compares each penalty term in f(y*) with the
         critical values of the normal distribution, and if the i-th penalty term
         is outside, for example, the 90% confidence interval of the normal
         distribution, then this measurement has a gross error with 90%
         probability. If no gross error exists somewhere in the set of
         measurements at step 218, data validation and reconciliation operations
         can conclude and produce low sampling rate reconciled data 222. If a
         gross error exists somewhere in the set of measurements at step 218,
         gross remediation 220 can begin.
    <BR><BR>[0053] Gross error remediation 220 can include either discarding or
         relaxing measurement systematic errors that can bias the reconciliation
         results. In some circumstances, gross error remediation 220 can include
         determining the measurement data that are biased by a systematic error
         and discarding these data from the data set. The determination of the
         measurement to be discarded can be based on different kinds of penalty
         terms that express the degree to which the measured values deviate from
         the reconciled values. After gross errors have been discarded from the
         measurement data, data reconciliation 210 can be performed without these
         erroneous data that can spoil the reconciliation process. In some
         instances, the elimination can be repeated until no gross error exists in
         the set of reconciled data. Further, in some circumstances where it is
         not possible to determine which measurement data are responsible for
         systematic errors, gross error remediation 220 can rely on relaxing the
         estimate for the uncertainty of suspicious measurements so that the
         reconciled values lie within, for example, the 90% confidence interval.
    <BR><BR>[0054] In some circumstances, a control command can be responsive to one
         or more dynamic models of the drill string 104 within the borehole 102.
         For example, the actual toolface orientation measurement value and the
         one or more of the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual DWOB
         measurement value can be used to estimate a drill string torsional
         compliance by analyzing the coupling dynamics between toolface angular
         displacement and DTOB. In some instances, the torsional compliance can be
         estimated using a drill string dynamic model that can be mathematical or
         knowledge-based. In other instances, the torsional compliance can be
         estimated by calculating the torsional compliance using actual
         observations at near past times that show the angular toolface
         displacements as a response to the downhole torque variations. In yet
         other instances, the torsional compliance can be estimated using a
         combination of a drill string dynamic model and actual observations,
         where the actual observations also can be used to update the drill string
         dynamic model.
    <BR><BR>[0055] Additionally, in some circumstances, the one or more computer
         programs, when executed by the one or more processors 132, can cause the
         system 100 to estimate one or more future values of one or more downhole
         variables and to determine an optimal ROP of the drill string 104
         responsive to a constrained optimization problem. Further, the control
         command can be responsive to the determined optimal ROP.
    <BR><BR>[0056] A control command can be for each of the top drive 114, the
         drawworks 116, and the mud pump 118, or for any combination of them. In
         some circumstances, determining the control command can include using
         multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) core logic to determine the control
         command. Further, the MIMO core logic can include a plurality of decision
         rules, and each of the decision rules can be associated with one or more
         of: drawworks control, top drive control, and mud pump control. The
         outcome of each decision rule can be scaled by a weight factor that,
         according to drilling conditions, can determine the impact of that
         decision rule on the final control command. An aggregation logic then can
         be used to combine the weighted results from different decision rules and
         to produce quantifiable control command(s) for one or more of the top
         drive 114, the drawworks 116, and the mud pump 118. Exemplary MIMO
         control logic can include, but is not limited to, a multivariable fuzzy
         logic controller and a multivariable model predictive controller.
    <BR><BR>[0057] Alternatively, in other circumstances, determining the control
         command can include using a first single-input, single-output (SISO)
         control logic to determine the control command for the top drive 114 and
         a second SISO control logic to determine the control command for the
         drawworks 116. Exemplary SISO control logic can include, but is not
         limited to, a conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
         controller and fuzzy logic controller, as will be understood by those
         skilled in the art.
    <BR><BR>[0058] For example, exemplary operations of a system or exemplary steps of
         a method 238 according to an embodiment are illustrated in FIG. 4. As
         depicted, inputs can include desired (that is, target) downhole variables
         240, target toolface orientation 242, and real-time information of
         drilling parameter variables 244. Such real-time information of drilling
         parameter variables 244 can be obtained from one or more sensors, such as
         downhole sensors 120 or surface sensors 122. Given the desired downhole
         variables 240, one or more of a target DWOB and a target DTOB 246 can be
         determined. Further, given the real-time information of drilling
         parameter variables 244, one or more of an actual DWOB and an actual DTOB
         248, as well as an actual toolface orientation 250, can be determined.
         Given one or more of a target DWOB and a target DTOB 246 and one or more
         of an actual DWOB and an actual DTOB 248, one or more of a DWOB scaled
         error and a DTOB scaled error 252 can be determined. Further, given the
         target toolface orientation 242 and the actual toolface orientation 250,
         a toolface orientation scaled error 254 can be determined. A system
         states and disturbance observer 256 then can operate responsive to the
         actual toolface orientation 250 and one or more of the actual DWOB and
         the actual DTOB 248. Further, a steering compliance estimator 258 can
         estimate the drill string torsional compliance responsive to the actual
         toolface orientation 250 and one or more of the actual DWOB and the
         actual DTOB 248. Given the toolface orientation scaled error 254, one or
         more of DWOB scaled error and DTOB scaled error 252, estimate from the
         steering compliance estimator 258, and input from the system states and
         disturbance observer 256, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control logic
         260 can operate to determine a command 262 to send to one or more
         drilling equipment driving systems. Output of the MIMO control logic 260
         also can feed back into the system states and disturbance observer 256 to
         be used for subsequent time-step calculations.
    <BR><BR>[0059] MIMO control logic can take into account the mutual effects among
         downhole torque, toolface orientation, top drive angle, and ROP, for
         example, as illustrated in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. For instance, MIMO control
         logic 302 can utilize input from a user through a graphical user
         interface (GUI) or another application 304, as well as input from one or
         more drilling sensors 306, as illustrated in FIG. 7. Input from a user
         through a graphical user interface (GUI) or another application 304 can
         include, for example, toolface orientation (TF) setpoint (that is, target
         toolface orientation), DTOB setpoint (that is, target DTOB), DWOB
         setpoint (that is, target DWOB), maximum ROP, maximum DiffP, slide
         length, maximum DTOB, and pipe tally, as will be understood by those
         skilled in the art. Further, input from one or more downhole drilling
         sensors 306 (such as downhole sensors 120, for example) can include
         actual toolface orientation, actual DTOB, actual DWOB, and actual
         downhole differential pressure (DDiffP), as will be understood by those
         skilled in the art. Still further, input from one or more surface
         drilling sensors 306 (such as surface sensors 122, for example) can
         include top drive (TD) orientation, ROP, WOB, DiffP, block height, hole
         depth, drill bit position, and survey, as will be understood by those
         skilled in the art. The output of the MIMO control logic 302 can include
         control commands to a top drive 308 regarding top drive orientation. Such
         control commands 308 can include one or more of angular position,
         throttle, and torque. Further, the output of the MIMO control logic 302
         can include commands to a drawworks 310 regarding ROP. Such drawworks
         commands 310 can include drilling line payoff, WOB, and DiffP. Still
         further, the output of the MIMO control logic 302 can include commands to
         a mud pump 311 regarding mud flow that can include mud pump strokes. For
         example, a controller 318 using the MIMO core logic 302 can utilize
         target DTOB 314 and a target toolface orientation 316 as inputs to
         generate a surface ROP command 320 that can be sent to a drawworks 310,
         as well as a surface top drive orientation command 322 that can be sent
         to a top drive 308, as illustrated in FIG. 8A, for example. Top drive 308
         can provide feedback regarding top drive orientation 324 to the MIMO
         control logic 302. In the drilling process 312, the operation of the
         drawworks 310 and top drive 308 then can modify DTOB and toolface
         orientation to produce updated DTOB 328 and TF 330. These updated
         drilling parameter measurements then can be fed back into the MIMO
         control logic 302 to be used for subsequent time-step calculations. In
         some instances, the controller 318 also can send a mud flow command 321
         to a mud pump 309, which can feed into the MIMO control logic 302, as
         illustrated in FIG. 8B, for example.
    <BR><BR>[0060] As an alternative to MIMO control logic 302, two disjointed SISO
         controllers (one for each of top drive orientation and surface ROP) can
         be used, as illustrated in FIG. 9, for example. Each independent SISO
         controller can compare its setpoint with its corresponding downhole
         actual value and accordingly can generate a command to the process. For
         instance, a SISO control logic performed by a controller associated with
         TF 338 can use TF setpoint 316 and actual TF 334 as inputs to determine a
         command to send to a top drive 308. Top drive can be used to compensate
         for error between the TF setpoint 316 and the actual TF 334. That is,
         operation of the top drive can be used to correct toolface orientation.
         Similarly, a SISO control logic performed by a controller associated with
         DTOB 340 can use DTOB setpoint 314 and actual DTOB 336 as inputs to
         determine a command to send to a drawworks 310. Drawworks can be used to
         compensate for error between the DTOB setpoint 314 and the actual DTOB
         336. That is, operation of the drawworks can be used to correct DTOB.
    <BR><BR>[0061] Another system according to an embodiment can include a controller
         130 that includes one or more processors 132. A system also can include a
         non-transitory computer-readable medium 136 in communication with the one
         or more processors 132 of the controller 130. The computer-readable
         medium 136 can have one or more computer programs stored thereon that,
         when executed by the one or more processors 132, cause the system to
         determine an actual downhole torque on bit (DTOB) measurement value and
         an actual toolface orientation measurement value for a drill string 104
         positioned in a borehole 102 for a hydrocarbon well. As an alternative to
         or in addition to determining the actual DTOB measurement value, a system
         can determine a DWOB measurement value; in such circumstances, steps
         performed by the system related to DTOB can instead be related to DWOB. A
         system also can determine, responsive to a comparison of a target DTOB
         measurement value and the actual DTOB measurement value, a DTOB error
         value. As an alternative to or in addition to determining the DTOB error
         value, a system can determine a DWOB error value. Further, a system can
         determine, responsive to a comparison of a target toolface orientation
         measurement value and the actual toolface orientation measurement value,
         a toolface orientation error value. In addition, a system can determine a
         control command for one or more of a top drive 114 and a drawworks 116
         responsive to the DTOB error value (and/or the DWOB error value) and the
         toolface orientation error value. A system further can operate one or
         more of the top drive 114 and the drawworks 116 responsive to the control
         command thereby to correct a toolface orientation of the drill string
         104.
    <BR><BR>[0062] In some instances, determining the actual DTOB measurement value
         can include determining an actual DWOB measurement value. Additionally,
         the actual DTOB measurement value can be a sensor measurement value, and
         the actual DWOB measurement value can be a sensor measurement value, as
         well. Further, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the
         actual toolface orientation measurement value can be responsive to one or
         more of: (a) one or more measurements at one or more sensors 120
         positioned within the borehole 102 and (b) an appropriate estimator, such
         as a Kalman filter. For example, DTOB and toolface orientation can be
         obtained or estimated from measurements by downhole sensors 120 or
         estimated by an appropriate estimator (such as a Kalman filter, for
         example) or a combination of both.
    <BR><BR>[0063] The controller 130 can be in communication with the one or more
         sensors 120 through one or more segments of wired drill pipe 106, in some
         circumstances. Further, a system also can determine a current top drive
         operation measurement value and a current drawworks operation measurement
         value, and the control command can be responsive to the current top drive
         operation measurement value and the current drawworks operation
         measurement value. In some instances, the control command can be for one
         or more of the top drive 114, the drawworks 116, and a mud pump 118. The
         one or more computer programs, when executed by the one or more
         processors 132, further can cause the system to determine a current mud
         pump operation measurement value and to operate the mud pump 118
         responsive to the control command thereby to correct a toolface
         orientation of the drill string 104.
    <BR><BR>[0064] Additionally, in some circumstances, determining the actual DTOB
         measurement value and the actual toolface measurement value can include
         validating the one or more measurements at the one or more sensors 120
         thereby to produce one or more validated measurements and filtering the
         one or more validated measurements thereby to produce one or more
         filtered measurements. Determining the actual DTOB measurement value and
         the actual toolface measurement value also can include reconciling the
         one or more filtered measurements thereby to produce one or more
         reconciled measurements and verifying the one or more reconciled
         measurements thereby to produce one or more verified measurements.
         Further, determining the actual DTOB measurement value and the actual
         toolface measurement value can include remediating gross errors in the
         one or more verified measurements thereby to produce the actual DTOB
         measurement value and the actual toolface measurement value.
    <BR><BR>[0065] Operation of the drawworks 116 can include altering a weight on bit
         (WOB) measurement value at a surface of the borehole, and operation of
         the top drive 114 can include altering one or more of an angle of the
         drill string 104 with respect to the surface and a rotational speed of
         the drill string 104 within the borehole 102.
    <BR><BR>[0066] Further, the control command can be responsive to one or more
         dynamic models of the drill string 104 within the borehole 102, and
         operation of the drawworks 116 can control ROP of the drill string 104. A
         system also can estimate one or more future values of one or more
         downhole variables and determine an optimal ROP of the drill string 104
         responsive to a constrained optimization problem. In addition, the
         control command can be responsive to the determined optimal ROP of the
         drill string 104.
    <BR><BR>[0067] In some circumstances, the one or more computer programs, when
         executed by the one or more processors 132, further can cause the system
         determine the target toolface orientation measurement value responsive to
         receipt of user input from a user computing device in communication with
         the controller 130 and to determine the target DTOB measurement value
         (and/or the target DWOB measurement value) responsive to receipt of the
         user input from the user computing device. Such user input can include,
         for example, one or more of: a preselected DTOB measurement value, a
         preselected ROP, a preselected DWOB, and a preselected mud motor
         differential pressure.
    <BR><BR>[0068] For instance, a user such as a directional driller can select a
         desired target DTOB measurement value directly. A target DTOB measurement
         value also can be automatically computed, such as by drilling application
         software, for example. That is, user input can include a preselected DTOB
         measurement value.
    <BR><BR>[0069] Further, user input can include a preselected ROP. A desired ROP
         can be selected by a directional driller or other user, for example, and
         the target DTOB measurement value can be determined as a function of the
         desired ROP:
    <BR><BR>  DTOB.sub.desired=g(ROP.sub.desired)
    <BR><BR>[0070] subject to: 1) WOB.sub.min.ltoreq.WOB.ltoreq.WOB.sub.max    [0071]
         2) DiffP.sub.min.ltoreq.DiffP.ltoreq.DiffP.sub.max  [0072] 3)
         RPM.sub.min.ltoreq.RPM.ltoreq.RPM.sub.max  [0073] 4) safety operational
         limits where RPM is drill bit torsional speed. The safety operational
         limits can include, but are not limited to, a hook-load limit, an annular
         pressure limit, and a vibration limit.
    <BR><BR>[0074] In addition, user input can include a preselected DWOB. The desired
         DWOB can be used to compute the desired DTOB as a function of the desired
         DWOB:
    <BR><BR>  DTOB.sub.desired=f(DWOB.sub.desired)
    <BR><BR>[0075] subject to: 1) ROP.sub.min.ltoreq.ROP.ltoreq.ROP.sub.max    [0076]
         2) DiffP.sub.min.ltoreq.DiffP.ltoreq.DiffP.sub.max  [0077] 3)
         RPM.sub.min.ltoreq.RPM.ltoreq.RPM.sub.max  [0078] 4) safety operational
         limits
    <BR><BR>[0079] User input still further can include a preselected mud motor
         differential pressure. A desired mud motor differential pressure can be
         used to compute the desired DTOB as a function of the desired DiffP:
    <BR><BR>  DTOB.sub.desired=f(.DELTA.P.sub.desired)
    <BR><BR>[0080] subject to: 1) ROP.sub.min.ltoreq.ROP.ltoreq.ROP.sub.max    [0081]
         2) DWOB.sub.min.ltoreq.DWOB.ltoreq.DWOB.sub.max  [0082] 3)
         RPM.sub.min.ltoreq.RPM.ltoreq.RPM.sub.max  [0083] 4) safety operational
         limits
    <BR><BR>[0084] The target DTOB measurement value also can be determined as a
         function of two or more of desired ROP, desired DWOB, desired DiffP, and
         desired drill bit RPM, subject to safety operational limits.
    <BR><BR>[0085] In addition to systems, embodiments of the invention can include
         methods to control directional drilling in borehole drilling for
         hydrocarbon wells. For example, a method according to an embodiment can
         include determining an actual DTOB measurement value (and/or an actual
         DWOB measurement value) and an actual toolface orientation measurement
         value for a drill string 104 positioned in a borehole 102 for a
         hydrocarbon well. A method also can include determining, responsive to a
         comparison of a target DTOB measurement value (and/or a target DWOB
         measurement value) and the actual DTOB measurement value (and/or the
         actual DWOB measurement value), a DTOB error value (and/or a DWOB error
         value). Further, a method can include determining, responsive to a
         comparison of a target toolface orientation measurement value and the
         actual toolface orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation
         error value. In addition, a method can include determining a control
         command for one or more of a top drive 114 and a drawworks 116 responsive
         to the DTOB error value (and/or the DWOB error value) and the toolface
         orientation error value. A method still further can include operating one
         or more of the top drive 114 and the drawworks 116 responsive to the
         control command thereby to correct a toolface orientation of the drill
         string 104.
    <BR><BR>[0086] In some circumstances, determining the actual DTOB measurement
         value can include determining an actual DWOB measurement value.
         Additionally, determining the actual DTOB measurement value (and/or the
         actual DWOB measurement value) and the actual toolface orientation
         measurement value can be responsive to one or more of: (a) one or more
         measurements at one or more sensors 120 positioned within the borehole
         102 and (b) a Kalman filter. Further, a method also can include receiving
         the one or more measurements from the one or more sensors 102 through one
         or more segments of wired drill pipe 106 and determining a current top
         drive operation measurement value and a current drawworks operation
         measurement value. The control command can be responsive to the current
         top drive operation measurement value and the current drawworks operation
         measurement value. The control command can be for one or more of the top
         drive, the drawworks, and a mud pump, and the method also can include
         determining a current mud pump operation measurement value and operating
         the mud pump responsive to the control command thereby to correct a
         toolface orientation of the drill string 104. Determining the actual DTOB
         measurement value (and/or the actual DWOB measurement value) and the
         actual toolface measurement value can include validating the one or more
         measurements at the one or more sensors 120 thereby to produce one or
         more validated measurements and filtering the one or more validated
         measurements thereby to produce one or more filtered measurements.
         Additionally, determining the actual DTOB measurement value (and/or the
         actual DWOB measurement value) and the actual toolface measurement value
         can include reconciling the one or more filtered measurements thereby to
         produce one or more reconciled measurements and verifying the one or more
         reconciled measurements thereby to produce one or more verified
         measurements. Determining the actual DTOB measurement value (and/or the
         actual DWOB measurement value) and the actual toolface measurement value
         also can include remediating gross errors in the one or more verified
         measurements thereby to produce the actual DTOB measurement value (and/or
         the actual DWOB measurement value) and the actual toolface measurement
         value.
    <BR><BR>[0087] Additionally, operation of the drawworks 116 can include altering a
         WOB measurement value at a surface of the borehole, and operation of the
         top drive 114 can include altering one or more of an angle of the drill
         string 104 with respect to the surface and a rotational speed of the
         drill string 104 within the borehole 102. A method also can include
         determining the target DTOB measurement value (and/or the target DWOB
         measurement value) responsive to receipt of user input from a user
         computing device. The user input can include one or more of: a
         preselected DTOB measurement value, a preselected rate of penetration, a
         preselected DWOB, and a preselected mud motor differential pressure. A
         method also can include determining the target toolface orientation
         measurement value responsive to receipt of the user input from the user
         computing device.
    <BR><BR>[0088] Further, the control command can be responsive to one or more
         dynamic models of the drill string 104 within the borehole 102, and
         operation of the drawworks 116 can control a ROP of the drill string 102.
         A method also can include estimating one or more future values of one or
         more downhole variables and determining an optimal ROP of the drill
         string 104 responsive to a constrained optimization problem.
         Additionally, the control command can be responsive to the determined
         optimal ROP of the drill string 104.
    <BR><BR>[0089] Embodiments also can include non-transitory computer-readable media
         to control directional drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon
         wells. For example, a non-transitory computer-readable medium according
         to an embodiment can have computer-executable instructions stored thereon
         that can be executed by one or more processors to perform a method, such
         as one or more of the methods described herein.
    <BR><BR>[0090] Another method according to an embodiment to control directional
         drilling in borehole drilling for hydrocarbon wells can include providing
         a directional drilling monitor application to a user on a user computing
         device 170, as illustrated in FIG. 6, for example. Such a user computing
         device 170 can include, for example, a desktop computer, a laptop, a
         smartphone, a tablet computer, or a personal digital assistant, among
         other examples. Further, the user computing device 170 can be positioned
         and located at or near a drilling site, but the user computing device 170
         also can be positioned at a remote location, such as an operator's office
         facility or remote operations center, for example, or at any other
         location. A user computing device 170 can include one or more processors
         172, one or more memories 174 (such as non-transitory computer-readable
         media) in communication with the one or more processors 172, and one or
         more displays 176 in communication with the one or more processors 172,
         for example.
    <BR><BR>[0091] A method also can include receiving measurements at a server 178
         from one or more sensors 120 positioned in a borehole 102 for a
         hydrocarbon well. The borehole 102 can extend from a surface into a
         subsurface of the hydrocarbon well. The server 178 can be positioned and
         located at the drilling site, but the server 178 also can be positioned
         at a remote location, similarly to the user computing device 170.
         Further, the server 178 and the user computer device 170 can be
         positioned at the same location, either at the drilling site or at a
         remote site, or the server 178 and the user computer device 170 can be
         positioned at different locations from each other, including two separate
         remote locations. The server 178 can include one or more processors 180
         and a memory 182 (such as a non-transitory computer-readable medium) that
         stores the user's preferences for information format and is in
         communication with the one or more processors 180. The server 178 can be
         in communication with the user computing device 170, a top drive 114, a
         drawworks 116, and the one or more sensors 120.
    <BR><BR>[0092] The one or more processors 180 of the server 178 can operate to
         perform a series of steps. For example, the one or more processors 180
         can operate to determine, responsive to the received measurements, an
         actual DTOB measurement value and an actual toolface orientation
         measurement value for a drill string 104 positioned in the borehole 102.
         The one or more processors 180 also can operate to determine a target
         DTOB measurement value responsive to receipt of user input from the user
         computing device 170. Further, the one or more processors 180 can operate
         to determine a target toolface orientation measurement value responsive
         to receipt of the user input from the user computing device 170. The one
         or more processors 180 also can operate to determine, responsive to a
         comparison of the target DTOB measurement value and the actual DTOB
         measurement value, a DTOB error value. In addition, the one or more
         processors 180 can operate to determine, responsive to a comparison of
         the target toolface orientation measurement value and the actual toolface
         orientation measurement value, a toolface orientation error value. Still
         further, the one or more processors 180 can operate to determine a
         control command for one or more of a top drive 114 and a drawworks 116 to
         correct each of the DTOB error value and the toolface orientation error
         value responsive to a current top drive operation measurement value and a
         current drawworks operation measurement value. The one or more processors
         180 also can operate to generate a directional drilling alert from the
         actual DTOB measurement value, the actual toolface orientation
         measurement value, and the control command. Further, the one or more
         processors 180 can operate to format the directional drilling alert
         according to the information format and transmit the formatted
         directional drilling alert to the user computing device 170 thereby to
         indicate a planned change in drill string orientation. In addition, the
         one or more processors 180 can operate one or more of the top drive 114
         and the drawworks 116 responsive to the control command thereby to
         correct a toolface orientation of the drill string 104. Operation of the
         drawworks 116 can include altering a WOB measurement value at the
         surface, and operation of the top drive 114 can include altering one or
         more of an angle of the drill string 104 with respect to the surface and
         a rotational speed of the drill string 104 within the borehole 102.
    <BR><BR>[0093] In some instances, a system according to an embodiment can include
         one or more modules. A module can include a set of instructions or
         operations or one or more portions of a software application that relate
         to and operate to effect certain functions of the software, for example,
         as will be understood by those skilled in the art. Computer-executable
         instructions that make up a software application can be stored on a
         non-transitory computer-readable medium, for example, such as those
         described herein. For example, as depicted in the exemplary system
         diagram illustrated in FIG. 2, an autonomous direct controlled steering
         system 150 according to an embodiment can be configured to automate
         directional drilling operations where a drill string 104 is guided along
         a non-vertical path. In operation, the high sampling rate drilling
         parameter sensors 168 (which can include downhole sensors 120 and surface
         sensors 122, for example) and a downhole drive controller 112 can provide
         data to a data validation and reconciliation module 162 via the
         substantially online data transmission system 164 (such as data
         transmission system 124), which can make direct control possible. Such a
         data validation and reconciliation module 162 can process the raw data
         and provide the refined information to an autonomous direct control
         system 152, which can evaluate the real-time performance of the steering
         operation and accordingly provide online operating commands to one or
         more drilling equipment driving systems 166. The one or more drilling
         equipment driving systems 166 can include the top drive 114, the
         drawworks 116, the mud pump 118, as well as controllers associated with
         any of the equipment used during drilling. A drilling equipment driving
         system 166 can be a drive control interface or software of any drilling
         equipment or apparatus that can either directly or indirectly affect one
         or more drilling parameters. Further, such equipment can be mounted in
         downhole or at the surface. Exemplary rig-mounted equipment includes, but
         is not limited to, rotating system equipment (such as one or more top
         drives 114), hoisting system equipment (such as one or more drawworks
         116), and circulating system equipment (such as one or more mud pumps
         118). Exemplary downhole equipment can include any downhole active or
         adjustable devices such as mud motors, turbines, bent subs or whipstocks,
         adjustable stabilizers, agitators, and rotary steerable systems.
    <BR><BR>[0094] Some or all of the data validation and reconciliation operations
         described above, including some or all of those illustrated in FIG. 3,
         can be performed by a data validation and reconciliation module 162, for
         example. In such an example, FIG. 3 can depict an exemplary workflow of
         the data validation and reconciliation module 162.
    <BR><BR>[0095] Further, the autonomous direct control system 152 can perform some
         of the other operations described above. The autonomous direct control
         system 152 can be in bidirectional communication with a common operation
         infrastructure, including an operator station 160. The operator station
         160 can provide a user interface that can be accessed by a directional
         driller on the rig or in a remote location, for example. The operator
         station 160 also can provide a location for providing manual input to the
         control system 152 and for manual override of the control system 152 if
         needed. The control station 160 can provide a visual representation of
         the operation of the autonomous direct control system 152, including the
         status of one or more drilling equipment 166 and a real-time
         representation of data received from the drilling parameter sensors 168.
         The BHA 108 can be coupled to and in communication with a rotating system
         (such as a top drive 114), a hoisting system (such as a drawworks 116),
         or other surface equipment via a drill pipe 106. Under an autonomous
         direct control operation, the raw data collected by the high sampling
         rate drilling parameter sensors 168 can be relayed to the data validation
         and reconciliation module 162 via the online data transmission system
         164. The drilling parameter sensors 168 also can be configured to receive
         operating instructions (in addition to sending measurements) via the
         online transmission system 164. The raw data collected by the drilling
         parameter sensors 168 can be processed online by the data validation and
         reconciliation module 162 to obtain refined information useful for
         decision-making by the autonomous direct control system 152.
    <BR><BR>[0096] An autonomous direct control system 152 can include one or more
         components referred to herein as mechanisms, such as a primary control
         mechanism 154, a secondary control mechanism 156, and a tertiary control
         mechanism 158. A mechanism as described can include a set of instructions
         or operations or a portion of a software application that relates to and
         operates to effect certain functions of the software, for example, as
         will be understood by those skilled in the art. Computer-executable
         instructions that make up a software application can be stored on a
         non-transitory computer-readable medium, for example, such as those
         described herein. In some instances, the autonomous direct control system
         152 depicted in FIG. 2 can include only a primary control mechanism 154
         that provides online operating commands to one or more drilling equipment
         driving systems 166 in order to ensure stability and robustness of
         automated directional drilling against a wide range of external
         disturbances, measurement uncertainties, and unknown environmental
         conditions. Such a primary control mechanism 154 can be fully implemented
         either in a downhole device or in a surface application. In either case,
         the communication between the surface and the downhole can be enabled by
         an online data transmission system 164.
    <BR><BR>[0097] Some or all of the operations described above, including some or
         all of those illustrated in FIG. 4, can be performed by such a primary
         control mechanism 154, for example. In such an example, FIG. 4 can depict
         a simplified block diagram and an exemplary workflow of the primary
         control mechanism 154. More specifically, FIG. 4 can illustrate an
         exemplary workflow of the primary control mechanism 154 utilizing control
         logic related to a disturbance rejection method. Such disturbance
         rejection control logic can receive a scaled deviation error of toolface
         orientation 254 and one or more of scaled deviation errors of DTOB and
         DWOB 252, along with drill string torsional compliance data, and
         accordingly can issue operating commands 262 via an output interface to
         one or more drilling equipment and apparatuses, including rotating system
         equipment such as top drives, hoisting system equipment such as
         drawworks, circulating system equipment such as mud pumps, and downhole
         RSS equipment. The control logic can be a multivariable (also called
         multi-input multi-output) control method with a model-independent core
         logic 262. In some instances, such active disturbance rejection control
         logic can include one or more proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
         controllers, where the input to each PID controller can be a function of
         the scaled deviation errors and drill string torsional compliance data.
         Further, in some circumstances, the control logic can be associated with
         a fuzzy logic controller. An extension of a system model with an
         additional and fictitious state variable that represents everything that
         a user does not include in a mathematical description of the plant of
         interest can be used, as well. A plant, as will be understood by those
         skilled in the art, can include a system on which the disturbance control
         logic can operate, including drilling equipment (such as sensors, a
         drawworks, a top drive, and a mud pump, for example) and information
         transmitted to and from the drilling equipment. This virtual state (sum
         of internal and external disturbances, sometimes denoted as a "total
         disturbance") can be estimated online with a state observer and used in
         the control signal in order to decouple unknown uncertainties from the
         rest of the drilling system. This disturbance rejection feature can allow
         the user to treat the considered system with a simpler model, since the
         negative effects of modeling uncertainty can be compensated in real time.
         As a result, it can eliminate a need for a precise analytical description
         of the system, as one can assume the unknown parts of dynamics as the
         internal disturbance in the drilling system. Robustness and the adaptive
         ability of this method can provide an advantageous solution in scenarios
         where the full knowledge of the drilling system is not available.
    <BR><BR>[0098] An additional method according to an embodiment is illustrated in
         FIG. 10, for example. Measurements can be taken 350 from one or more
         downhole sensors 120 positioned along a drill string 104, including
         measurements related to toolface orientation, downhole WOB (DWOB),
         downhole torque (Dtorque), and downhole differential pressure (Ddiff P).
         These measurements can be used to determine toolface orientation, which
         can be filtered 352 to generate a toolface estimate 354. The toolface
         estimate 354 and a target toolface 316 can be summed 356, then
         optimization criteria can be selected 358. A torque command can be
         processed 360 and used as an input to a state space MIMO 362. The state
         space MIMO 362 can include inputs of downhole bit torque, surface torque,
         downhole WOB, and downhole differential pressure. The state space MIMO
         362 further can utilize as given inputs the length of the drill pipe, the
         type and size of the drill pipe, and one or more optimizing parameters.
         Outputs of the state space MIMO 362 can include line payoff, pipe
         rotation, and pump speed. Line payoff, drill pipe incremental rotation,
         and bit speed then can be sent to one or more controllers 364, which can
         control operation of a drawworks, a pipe rotator (which can be a subset
         of a top drive control), and a pump controller.
    <BR><BR>[0099] Further, an additional system according to an embodiment is
         illustrated in FIG. 11, for example. Such a system can allow input from
         one or more users 372 through a user interface 374. The user interface
         374 can be in communication, through input/output services 376, with
         surface instrumentation 378, downhole instrumentation 382, a rig control
         system 384, data services 386, and an application engine 380. The
         application engine 380 can perform one or more of the operations or
         methods described herein. Further, the data services 386 can be in
         communication with configuration storage 388 and data logging 390.
    <BR><BR>[0100] Embodiments of the invention thus can provide autonomous direct
         controlled steering in directional drilling that can include: a drilling
         parameter sensor with high sampling rate; a data validation and
         reconciliation module that can be communicatively coupled to the drilling
         parameter sensor through an online data transmission system and can
         generate processed data from the raw data gathered by the drilling
         parameter sensor; a primary control mechanism that can enhance stability
         and robustness of automated directional drilling by online commanding a
         drilling equipment driving system; a secondary control mechanism that
         adaptively can guide the primary control mechanism based on a drill
         string dynamic model; and a tertiary control mechanism that can determine
         an optimal rate of penetration by online solving a constrained
         optimization problem.
    <BR><BR>[0101] Consequently, embodiments of the invention can provide drilling
         optimization software to automate and optimize directional drilling
         practices to set and continuously maintain downhole equipment orientation
         while also optimizing drilling rate of penetration. Such a software
         application can achieve this automation by applying downhole measurements
         of torque, WOB, and differential pressure to continuously control surface
         pipe rotary and drawworks systems. Further, such a software application
         also can enable automated directional drilling to be performed and
         monitored from a remote operations center.
