        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install patent_client
        
        If you only want access to USPTO resources, you're done!
        However, additional setup is necessary to access EPO Inpadoc and EPO Register resources. See the `Docs <http://patent-client.readthedocs.io>`_.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        The easiest way to get started is with `Patent Client Examples <https://github.com/parkerhancock/patent_client_examples>`_. The examples repository has
        a list of Jupyter notebooks showing application examples of the patent_client library.
        
        Docs, including a fulsome Getting Started are available on `Read the Docs <http://patent-client.readthedocs.io>`_.
        
        SUPER QUICK START
        -----------------
        
        To use the project:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Import the model classes you need
            >>> from patent_client import Inpadoc, Assignment, USApplication, Patent
        
            # Fetch US Patents with the word "tennis" in their title issued in 2010
            >>> pats = Patent.objects.filter(title="tennis", issue_date="2010-01-01->2010-12-31")
            >>> len(pats) > 10
            True
            
            # Look at the first one
            >>> pats[0].publication
            Patent(publication_number=7841958, publication_date=2010-11-30, title=Modular table tennis game)
        
            # Fetch US Applications
            >>> app = USApplication.objects.get('15710770')
            >>> app.patent_title
            'Camera Assembly with Concave-Shaped Front Face'
        
            # Fetch from USPTO Assignments
            >>> assignments = Assignment.objects.filter(assignee='Google')
            >>> len(assignments) > 23000
            True
            >>> assignment = Assignment.objects.get('47086-788')
            >>> assignment.conveyance_text
            'ASSIGNMENT OF ASSIGNORS INTEREST'
        
            # Fetch from INPADOC
            # >>> pub = Inpadoc.objects.get('EP3082535A1')
            # >>> pub.biblio.title
            # 'AUTOMATIC FLUID DISPENSER'
        
            # Fetch from EPO Register (NOTE: This is broken right now :( )
            #>>> epo = Epo.objects.get('EP3082535A1')
            #>>> epo.title
            #'AUTOMATIC FLUID DISPENSER'
            #>>> epo.status
            #[{'description': 'Examination is in progress', 'code': '14', 'date': '20180615'}]
        
        Other Languages
        ===============
        
        Merely as a way to explore other languages and technologies, I have built a few (partial) ports of this
        library to other languages:
        
        * `patent_client_js <https://github.com/parkerhancock/patent_client_js>`_ - ES6 Javascript (PEDS / PTAB / Assignments support (ASYNC!))
        * `patent_client_java <https://github.com/parkerhancock/patent_client_java>`_ - Java (Ptab API only)
        * `patent_client_scala <https://github.com/parkerhancock/patent_client_scala>`_ - Scala (Ptab API only)
        * `patent_client_ruby <https://github.com/parkerhancock/patent_client_ruby>`_ - Ruby (Nothing Works Yet)
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        To run the all tests run::
        
            pytest
        
        A developer guide is provided in the `Documentation <http://patent-client.readthedocs.io>`_.
        Pull requests welcome!
