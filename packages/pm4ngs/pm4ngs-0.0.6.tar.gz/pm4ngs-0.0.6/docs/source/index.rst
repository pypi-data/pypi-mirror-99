Introduction
------------

`PM4NGS`_ was designed to generate a standard organizational structure for Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) data analysis. It includes a directory structure for the project, several Jupyter notebooks for data management
and CWL workflows for pipeline execution.

Our work was inspired by a manuscript by Prof. William Noble in 2009:
`A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects`_. We recommend reading this paper for a better
understanding of the guiding principles of our project.

The project is composed of three main parts.

#. A project organizational structure which define standard files and directories for the project
#. Jupyter Notebooks as user interfaces for data management and visualization
#. CWL workflows that execute the data analysis

**PM4NGS** source code includes the templates used by **cookiecutter** to generate the project
organizational structure and the Jupyter notebooks. The CWL workflows are defined in a separate GitHub project named:
`cwl-ngs-workflows-cbb`_.

Features
--------

* NGS data integration, management and analysis uses Jupyter notebooks, CWL workflows and cookiecutter project templates
* Easy installation and use with a minimum command line interaction
* Data analysis CWL workflows executed from the Jupyter notebook with automatic failing detection and can be validated with published data
* CWL workflows and Jupyter Notebooks are ready for cloud computing
* Project reports and dynamic content creation after data processing using CWL workflows are included
* Optional use of Docker/Biocontainers or Conda/Bioconda for Bioinformatics tool installations and managements are also included
