1.0 (2015-02-2015)
------------------

- Fix a condition, where the ``startdate`` string literal was checked, if it's
  an instance of ``String``, which returned False. This led to the case, where
  the list of occurrences wasn't shown. String literals should be checked
  with``typeof`` instead of ``instanceof``.
  See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/203757/3036508
  [thet]

- Fixes an issue introduced with previous change, where the recurrence overlay
  couldn't be opened in cases, the startdate was already a Date object.
  [thet]

- Be a bit more clever about guessing the startdate from the surrounding form.
  Also, convert human-readable, non ISO8601 date strings to something
  interpretable by the Date function, like '2014-04-24 19:00', where the 'T'
  separator is missing.
  [thet]

- Fire change events when rrule value is updated.
  [deiferni]

- Default to one week of daily occurrences, instead of 10.
  [gyst]

- Remove ambiguous recurrence rule checkbox, which lead to UX confusion due to
  double negation (unchecked checkbox said "no recurrence rule") and add
  instead a "Delete" button.
  Fixes: https://github.com/plone/plone.app.event/issues/70
  [thet]

- When there is no recurrence rule, the edit button should show "Add...", not
  "Edit...". Fixes: https://github.com/plone/plone.app.event/issues/43
  [thet]

- Fix ie8 startdate and fire events when changing checkbox values.
  [deiferni]

- Make "repeat forever" button optional.
  [deiferni]

- Fix of parsing error of valid "RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=3;BYDAY=3TH",
  where the missing '+' sign in the BYDAY Weekdaylist was causing the error.
  [Aridor2006]

- Move jquery.recurrenceinput.css from demo/ to src/ directory. This file is
  likely to be needed for integration.
  [thet]

- Backport pbauers fix of "use strict is not a function".
  [thet]

- fix pull-request #9: recurrence end date not properly saved.
  [aroemen, thet]

  and save buttons. this allows frameworks to react on submit for buttons
  marked with a special class.
  [thet]

  ajax request sent to the server for getting the recurrence occurences.
  [thet]

  [regebro]

  [regebro]

  [regebro]

  option added to set which is the first day of the month.

  recurrence rules with unlimited occurences are not selected by accident but
  intentionally.
