        :honeybee: :green_book: :zap: Honeybee Radiance plugin for Grasshopper (aka. honeybee[+]).
        
        This repository contains all radiance modeling Grasshopper components for the honeybee
        plugin. The package includes both the user objects (`.ghuser`) and the Python
        source (`.py`). Note that this library only possesses the Grasshopper components
        and, in order to run the plugin, the core libraries must be installed in a way that
        they can be found by Rhino (see dependencies).
