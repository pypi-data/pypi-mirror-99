    Gets a mean (y) line, binned in the x direction.

    Parameters
    ----------

    x: unyt.unyt_array
        Horizontal values, to be binned.

    y: unyt.unyt_array
        Vertical values, to have the mean calculated in the x-bins

    x_bins: unyt.unyt_array
        Horizontal bin edges. Must have the same units as x.

    minimum_in_bin: int, optional
        Minimum number of items in a bin to return that bin. If a bin has
        fewer values than this, it is excluded from the return values.
        Default: 3.

    return_additional: bool, optional
        Boolean. If true, makes the function return x and y data points that
        lie in the bins where the number of data points is smaller than
        minimum_in_bin, and any points that are higher than the highest bin
        edge. Default: false.

    minimum_additional_points: int, optional
        Minimum number of additional data points with the highest values of x to return.
        Has to be used with return_additional=True. If set to N, then at least N
        additional data points will always be present in the plot, regardless of how the
        adaptive binning is done. The adaptive binning is stopped at the lowest value of
        x among the additional data points so that these points and the mean line do
        not overlap.


    Returns
    -------

    bin_centers: unyt.unyt_array
        The centers of the bins (taken to be the linear mean of the bin edges).

    means: unyt.unyt_array
        Vertical mean values within the bins.

    standard_deviation: unyt.unyt_array
        Standard deviation within the bins, to be shown as scatter.

    additional_x: unyt.unyt_array, optional
        x data points from the bins where the number of data points is smaller
        than minimum_in_bin

    additional_y: unyt.unyt_array, optional
        y data points from the bins where the number of data points is smaller
        than minimum_in_bin
