# Various forms of data interchange

Text-Fabric can interchange data with MQL, see `tf.convert.mql`.

It has also support for converting streams of data to Text-Fabric format,
see `tf.convert.walker`.

And there is support for round trips of TF data to annotation tools and back,
see `tf.convert.recorder`.

You can *explode* plain TF files in big, non-optimized data files,
see `tf.convert.tf.explode`.
