# Clean

From version 7.7.7 onwards, Text-Fabric uses a parameter `tf.parameters.PACK_VERSION`
to mark the stored pre-computed data.
Whenever there are incompatible changes in the packed data format, this
version number will be increased and Text-Fabric will not attempt to load
the older pre-computed data.

The older data will not be removed, however.
Use the function `clean` to get rid of pre-computed data
that you no longer need.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Removes all precomputed data resulting from other `PACK_VERSION`s
    than the one currently used by Text-Fabric.

    You find the current pack version in
    `tf.parameters`

    tfd: boolean,  optional `True`
        By default, your `~/text-fabric-data` is traversed and cleaned,
        but if you pass `tfd=False` it will be skipped.
    gh: boolean, optional, `False`
        By default, your `~/github` will be skipped,
        but if you pass `gh=True` it will be
        traversed and cleaned.
    specific: string, optional, `None`
        You can pass a specific directory here. The standard directories
        `~/github` and `~/text-fabric-data` will not be used, only
        the directory you pass here. `~` will be expanded to your home directory.
    current: boolean, optional, `False`
        If current=True, also the precomputed results of the current version will
        be removed.
    dry: boolean, optional, `False`
        By default, nothing will be deleted, and you only get a list of
        what will be deleted if it were not a dry run.
        If you pass `dry=False` the delete actions will really be executed.
