Plain text feature files will be compressed to zipped, pickled datastructures

These methods evolve, sometimes in incompatible ways.
In those cases we bump this version number.
That will cause TF not to use compressed files that have been compressed by
older, incompatible methods.
Instead, TF will produce freshly compressed data files.

The compressed data files are stored in a directory `.tf/{PVN}/` next
to the original `tf`  files, where `{PVN}` is the package version number.

We do not aim for backward compatibility, since it is very easy to obtain a new version
of an app.

When Text-Fabric loads a TF app, it will check the api version that the app requires
against this version.

App requirement higher than TF API version
