Rally job
=========

We provide, with Watcher, a Rally plugin you can use to benchmark the optimization service.

To launch this task with configured Rally you just need to run:

::

  rally task start watcher/rally-jobs/watcher-watcher.yaml

Structure
---------

* plugins - directory where you can add rally plugins. Almost everything in
  Rally is a plugin. Benchmark context, Benchmark scenario, SLA checks, Generic
  cleanup resources, ....

* extra - all files from this directory will be copy pasted to gates, so you
  are able to use absolute paths in rally tasks.
  Files will be located in ~/.rally/extra/*

* watcher.yaml is a task that is run in gates against OpenStack
  deployed by DevStack
