features:

    Server(migrate Action) API which has host option since v2.56.
upgrade:
  - |
    Nova API version is now set to 2.56 by default. This needs the migrate
    action of migration type cold with destination_node parameter to work.
fixes:
  - |
    The migrate action of migration type cold with destination_node parameter
    was fixed. Before fixing, it booted an instance in the service project
    as a migrated instance.
