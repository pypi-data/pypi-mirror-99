features:
  - |
    All datasources can now be configured to retry retrieving a metric upon
    encountering an error. Between each attempt will be a set amount of time
    which can be adjusted from the configuration. These configuration
    options can be found in the `[watcher_datasources]` group and are named
    `query_max_retries` and `query_timeout`.
upgrade:
  - |
    If Gnocchi was configured to have a custom amount of retries and or a
    custom timeout then the configuration needs to moved into the
    `[watcher_datasources]` group instead of the `[gnocchi_client]` group.
deprecations:
  - |
    The configuration options for query retries in `[gnocchi_client]` are
    deprecated and the option in `[watcher_datasources]` should now be used.
