    Added a new config option 'action_execution_rule' which is a dict type.
    Its key field is strategy name and the value is 'ALWAYS' or 'ANY'.
    'ALWAYS' means the callback function returns True as usual.
    'ANY' means the return depends on the result of previous action execution.
    The callback returns True if previous action gets failed, and the engine
    continues to run the next action. If previous action executes success,
    the callback returns False then the next action will be ignored.
    For strategies that aren't in 'action_execution_rule', the callback always
    returns True.
    Please add the next section in the watcher.conf file
    if your strategy needs this feature.
    [watcher_workflow_engines.taskflow]
    action_execution_rule = {'your strategy name': 'ANY'}
