features:
    Watcher starts to support API microversions since Stein cycle. From now
    onwards all API changes should be made with saving backward compatibility.
    To specify API version operator should use OpenStack-API-Version
    HTTP header. If operator wants to know the mininum and maximum supported
    versions by API, he/she can access /v1 resource and Watcher API will
    return appropriate headers in response.
