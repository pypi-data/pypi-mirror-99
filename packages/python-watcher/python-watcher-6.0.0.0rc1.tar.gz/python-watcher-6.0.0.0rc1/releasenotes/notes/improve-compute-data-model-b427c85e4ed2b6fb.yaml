    Watcher can get resource information such as total, allocation ratio and
    reserved information from Placement API.
    Now we add some new fields to the Watcher Data Model:

    * vcpu_reserved: The amount of cpu a node has reserved for its own use.
    * vcpu_ratio: CPU allocation ratio.
    * memory_mb_reserved: The amount of memory a node has reserved for
      its own use.
    * memory_ratio: Memory allocation ratio.
    * disk_gb_reserved: The amount of disk a node has reserved for its own use.
    * disk_ratio: Disk allocation ratio.

    We also add some new propeties:

    * vcpu_capacity: The amount of vcpu, take allocation ratio into account,
      but do not include reserved.
    * memory_mb_capacity: The amount of memory, take allocation ratio into
      account, but do not include reserved.
    * disk_gb_capacity: The amount of disk, take allocation ratio into
      account, but do not include reserved.
