    Grafana has been added as datasource that can be used for collecting
    metrics. The configuration options allow to specify what metrics and how
    they are stored in grafana so that no matter how Grafana is configured it
    can still be used. The configuration can be done via the typical
    configuration file but it is recommended to configure most options in the
    yaml file for metrics. For a complete walkthrough on configuring Grafana
