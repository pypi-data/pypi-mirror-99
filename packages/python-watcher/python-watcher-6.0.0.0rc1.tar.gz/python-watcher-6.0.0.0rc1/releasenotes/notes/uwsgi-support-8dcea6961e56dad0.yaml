upgrade:
  - |
    An Watcher API WSGI application script ``watcher-api-wsgi`` is now
    available. It is auto-generated by ``pbr`` and allows to run the API
    service using WSGI server (for example Nginx and uWSGI).
deprecations:
  - |
    Using ``watcher/api/app.wsgi`` script is deprecated and it will be removed
    in U release.
    Please switch to automatically generated ``watcher-api-wsgi`` script
    instead.
