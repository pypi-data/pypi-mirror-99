    Added a strategy for one compute node maintenance,
    without having the user's application been interrupted.
    If given one backup node, the strategy will firstly
    migrate all instances from the maintenance node to
    the backup node. If the backup node is not provided,
    it will migrate all instances, relying on nova-scheduler.
