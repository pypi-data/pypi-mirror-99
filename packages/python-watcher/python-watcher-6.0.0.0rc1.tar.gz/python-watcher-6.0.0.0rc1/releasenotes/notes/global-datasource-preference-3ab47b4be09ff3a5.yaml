    Watcher now supports configuring which datasource to use and in which
    order. This configuration is done by specifying datasources in the
    watcher_datasources section:

    - ``[watcher_datasources] datasources = gnocchi,monasca,ceilometer``

    Specific strategies can override this order and use datasources which
    are not listed in the global preference.
