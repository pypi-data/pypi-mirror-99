features:
  - There is new ability to create Watcher continuous audits with cron
    interval. It means you may use, for example, optional argument
    '--interval "\*/5 \* \* \* \*"' to launch audit every 5 minutes.
    These jobs are executed on a best effort basis and therefore, we
    recommend you to use a minimal cron interval of at least one minute.
