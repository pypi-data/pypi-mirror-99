features:
  - |
    Improved interface for datasource baseclass that better defines expected
    values and types for parameters and return types of all abstract methods.
    This allows all strategies to work with every datasource provided the
    metrics are configured for that given datasource.
deprecations:
  - |
    The new strategy baseclass has significant changes in method parameters
    and any out-of-tree strategies will have to be adopted.
  - |
    Several strategies have changed the `node` parameter to `compute_node` to
    be better aligned with terminology. These strategies include
    `basic_consolidation` and `workload_stabilzation`. The `node` parameter
    will remain supported during Train release and will be removed in the
    subsequent release.
