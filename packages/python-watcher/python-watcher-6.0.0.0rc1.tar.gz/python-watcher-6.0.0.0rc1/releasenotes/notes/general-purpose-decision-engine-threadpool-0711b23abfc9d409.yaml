    Many operations in the decision engine will block on I/O. Such I/O
    operations can stall the execution of a sequential application
    significantly. To reduce the potential bottleneck of many operations
    the general purpose decision engine threadpool is introduced.
features:
  - |
    A new threadpool for the decision engine that contributors can use to
    improve the performance of many operations, primarily I/O bound onces.
    The amount of workers used by the decision engine threadpool can be
    configured to scale according to the available infrastructure using
    the `watcher_decision_engine.max_general_workers` config option.
    Documentation for contributors to effectively use this threadpool is
    available online:
    https://docs.openstack.org/watcher/latest/contributor/concurrency.html

    The building of the compute (Nova) data model will be done using the
    decision engine threadpool, thereby, significantly reducing the total
    time required to build it.
