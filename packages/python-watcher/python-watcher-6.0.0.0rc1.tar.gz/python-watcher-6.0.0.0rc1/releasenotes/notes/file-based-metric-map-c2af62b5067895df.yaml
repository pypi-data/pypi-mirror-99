    Allow using file to override metric map. Override the metric map of
    each datasource as soon as it is created by the manager. This override
    comes from a file whose path is provided by a setting in config file.
    The setting is `watcher_decision_engine/metric_map_path`.  The file
    contains a map per datasource whose keys are the metric names as
    recognized by watcher and the value is the real name of the metric
    in the datasource. This setting defaults to `/etc/watcher/metric_map.yaml`,
    and presence of this file is optional.
