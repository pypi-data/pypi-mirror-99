    Add show data model api for Watcher. New in version 1.3.
    User can use 'openstack optimize datamodel list'
    command to view the current data model information in memory.
    User can also add '--audit <Audit_UUID>' to view specific data model
    in memory filted by the scope in audit.
    User can also add '--detail' to view detailed information about current data model.
    User can also add '--type <type>' to specify the type of data model.
    Default type is 'compute'. In the future, type 'storage' and 'baremetal'
    will be supported.
