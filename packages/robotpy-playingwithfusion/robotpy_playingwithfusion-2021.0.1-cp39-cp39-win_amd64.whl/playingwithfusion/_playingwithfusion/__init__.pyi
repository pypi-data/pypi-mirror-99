    CAN based Venom motor controller instance

    This class is used to control a single Venom motor connected to the roboRIO
    through the CAN bus.  The motor supports many controls modes, including:
    Proportional Dutycycle, Voltage compensated proportional, closed-loop current,
    closed-loop speed with true s-curve trajector planning, closed-loop position
    control and motion profile execution

        Motion profiles are generally

        Generally
        used when more that one Venom is geared together in a drivetrain
        application.  In that case one Venom, the leader, executes a motion
        profile or is placed in another control mode.  The other Venom(s)
        are placed in FolloewTheLeader and command the same duty cycle as
        the leader so that only the leader is used to calculate closed-loop
        commands.  This avoid implementing PID controllers on multiple motors

        points are loaded and the motor cannot buffer the entire path.

        Venom can buffer about 300 points.  The exact buffer length can be
        be determined by calling :class:`.GetNumAvaliableMotionProfilePoints`
        immediatly after power up.  If the motion profile contains more points
        than can be stored in the buffer, the profile must be reloaded each time
        before begining to follow the profile.

        For large paths with many points, first load a subset of the points,
        begin executing the path, then continue to load new points as the motor
        executes the path.   Call the :class:`.GetNumAvaliableMotionProfilePoints`
        function periodically to ensure the Venom buffer has sufficient space
        before loading additional points.

        hold the current position (at zero speed) until the motor is placed

        - In this mode a PID active controls the motor duty cycle to achieve the commanded current.

        between 0.0 and 14.0 Volts.  - This mode is also refered to as voltage compensated proportional
        mode.  - Is is useful because the motor speed at a given voltage voltage will be constant if the
        battery voltage changes, as long as the voltage command is less than the battery voltage.

        Specify the region of the imaging sensor used for range measurement.

        The region of interest refers to the pixels within the time of flight imaging sensor
        that are used to detect reflected laser light form the target.  The sensor contains
        a 16x16 pixel grid.   By default, all 256 pixels are used which results in a roughly
        27 degree field of view.

        The Field of view refers to a cone which grows from the time of flight sensor outward.
        By reducing the size of the region of interest (by using a smaller area of pixels) it is
        possible to reduce the field of view.  This can be helpfull when measuring objects far
        away.  The smaller the field of view, the smaller the area where the sensor can detect
        targets.

        Reducing the region of interest will reduce the sensitivity of the sensor.  It may be
        necessary to increase the reflectivity of the target or to increase the sample time to
        compensate.

        The range of interest rows and columns must be greater or equal to zero and less than
        or equal to fifteen.   The top left corner row/column must be smaller than the bottom
        right column/row.  The region of interest must be at least four coulmns wide and four
        rows tall.   For example, to specify a 4x4 region at the center of the image sensor use:

        :param topLeftX:     Column of the top left corner of the region of interest.
        :param topLeftY:     Row of the top left corner of the region of interest.

        :param bottomRightY: Row of the bottom right corner of the region of interest.

        in bright lighting conditions, but can only measure 1.3 meters.   Long mode
        can measure up to 4 meters in the dark, but may only be able to measure
        shorter distances depending on the lighting conditions.  See the Vl53L1x
        datasheet for more information

        The sample time specifies the how frequently the time of flight sensor attempts
        to measure the distance to a target.  The sample time must be between 24 and
        1000 milliseconds.
