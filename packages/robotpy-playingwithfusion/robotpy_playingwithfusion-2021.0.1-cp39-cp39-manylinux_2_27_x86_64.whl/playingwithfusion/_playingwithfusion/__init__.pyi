        Specify the region of the imaging sensor used for range measurement.

        The region of interest refers to the pixels within the time of flight imaging sensor
        that are used to detect reflected laser light form the target.  The sensor contains
        a 16x16 pixel grid.   By default, all 256 pixels are used which results in a roughly
        27 degree field of view.

        The Field of view refers to a cone which grows from the time of flight sensor outward.
        By reducing the size of the region of interest (by using a smaller area of pixels) it is
        possible to reduce the field of view.  This can be helpfull when measuring objects far
        away.  The smaller the field of view, the smaller the area where the sensor can detect
        targets.

        Reducing the region of interest will reduce the sensitivity of the sensor.  It may be
        necessary to increase the reflectivity of the target or to increase the sample time to
        compensate.

        The range of interest rows and columns must be greater or equal to zero and less than
        or equal to fifteen.   The top left corner row/column must be smaller than the bottom
        right column/row.  The region of interest must be at least four coulmns wide and four
        rows tall.   For example, to specify a 4x4 region at the center of the image sensor use:

        :param topLeftX:     Column of the top left corner of the region of interest.
        :param topLeftY:     Row of the top left corner of the region of interest.

        shorter distances depending on the lighting conditions.  See the Vl53L1x

        The sample time specifies the how frequently the time of flight sensor attempts
