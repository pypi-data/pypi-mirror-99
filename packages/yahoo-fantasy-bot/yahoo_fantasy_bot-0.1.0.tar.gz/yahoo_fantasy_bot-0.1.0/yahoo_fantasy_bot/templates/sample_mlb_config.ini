# - NHL use .nhl

# The class loader is a function that produces a class for the prediction
# builder.  It takes two arguments: yahoo_fantasy_api.League object and
# configparser.  The prediction builder object has one API that must exist:
# predict().  The first positional argument must be a list of players.

# - 'yahoo' meaning we will use the current season stats
# - 'yahoo_lastseason' meaning we will use the stats from last season
# - 'yahoo_lastmonth' means we will use the stats for the last month
# - 'csv' means we will get the predicted stats from an external .csv file
# NOTE: When changing this value you must use the --resetcache option to
# remove any cached files that were using the old stats source.
