What is Ingeniamotion?
======================

Ingeniamotion is a library that works over ingenialink and aims to simplify the interaction with Ingenia's drives.

How it works?
-------------

All ingeniamotion functionalities works through the MotionController class. So, first of all we should
instantiate a MotionController object.

.. code-block:: python

    from ingeniamotion import MotionController
    mc = MotionController()

Now, ``mc`` is our MotionController instance.

Then, we should connect some servos.

.. code-block:: python

    # In case we want to connect only one servo
    mc.communication.connect_servo_eoe("192.168.2.22", "eve-net_1.7.0.xdf")

    # In case we want to connect more servos
    mc.communication.connect_servo_eoe("192.168.2.22", "eve-net_1.7.0.xdf",
                                       alias="servo_one")
    mc.communication.connect_servo_eoe("192.168.2.23", "eve-net_1.7.0.xdf",
                                       alias="servo_two")
    # The "alias" field will allow to reference these servos in the future.
    # The "alias" can be whatever we want to use as identifier.

Now, the servos are ready and we can work with them.

We then can apply some configurations:

.. code-block:: python

    # If we have only one servo
    mc.configuration.release_brake()
    # By default it uses the axis 1

Or we can execute some tests or calibrations:

.. code-block:: python

    mc.tests.digital_halls_test(servo="servo_one", axis=1)

    mc.tests.commutation(servo="servo_two", axis=1)

MotionController namespaces
---------------------------

MotionController functionalities are group in the following namespaces.

**Motion**

In this namespace we will find all the functions that will help us to move the servos.

**Communication**

This namespace has all the basic communication functions with the servo:
connect, read or write a register, load or save configuration, load firmware, etc.

**Configuration**

Here we will find functions to configure the servo: configure limits, feedbacks, brake settings, etc.

**Capture**

This namespace will help us to work with monitoring and similar features.

**Tests**

The functions of this namespace will help us to lunch some tests for the commissioning process.
