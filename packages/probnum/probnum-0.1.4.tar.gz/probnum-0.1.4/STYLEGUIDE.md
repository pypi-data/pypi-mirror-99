# Style Guide

This style guide summarizes code conventions used in ProbNum. This is intended as a reference for developers.

ProbNum uses
[*Black*'s formatting ruleset](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md), which
can be viewed as a strict subset of [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), and we recommend
[*Black*](https://github.com/psf/black) for automated code formatting.

With respect to code style, the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
should be applied with some notable additions and exceptions (i.e. docstrings, ...). We summarize and expand on this
style guide below.

## Code

### Imports
Use absolute imports over relative imports.

- `import x` for importing packages and modules.
- `from x import y` where `x` is the package prefix and `y` is the module name with no prefix.
- `from x import y as z` if two modules named `y` are to be imported or if `y` is an inconveniently long name.
- `import y as z` only when `z` is a standard abbreviation (e.g. `np` for `numpy`).

Use `__all__ = [...]` in `__init__.py` files to fix the order in which the methods are visible in the documentation.
This also avoids importing unnecessary functions via import statements ``from ... import *``.
Many classes and functions are "pulled up" to a higher-level namespace via `__init__.
py`
files. Import from there wherever there is no chance for
confusion and/or circular imports. This makes imports more readable. When changing the namespace of classes make sure to
to correct module paths in the documentation by adding `SuperClass.__module__ = "probnum.module"` to the corresponding
`__init.py__`.

#### Conventions
If imports are shortened, the following conventions should be used. Full import
paths are always acceptable.

- `import probnum as pn`
- `from probnum import randvars, linalg, diffeq, statespace`

An exception from these rules are type-related modules, which include `typing` and `probnum.type`.
Types are always imported directly.

- `from typing import Optional, Callable`
- `from probnum.type import FloatArgType`

Please do not abbreviate import paths unnecessarily. We do **not** use the following imports:
- `import probnum.random_variables as pnrv` or `import probnum.filtsmooth as pnfs` (correct would be `from probnum import randvars, filtsmooth`)
- `from probnum import random_variables as rvs` or `import probnum.random_variables as rvs` (the `randvars` name is sufficiently short and does not need to be abbreviated)

While all of these rules obey the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html),
we use one import convention that deviates from this guide.
If two objects (functions, classes) share the same namespace
(i.e. `RandomVariable` and `Normal` are both imported via `probnum.randvars`, but their implementation is in different
files, `randvars/_randomvariable.py` and `randvars/_normal.py`)
and one object needs to be imported into the module of the other object, use relative imports. For instance, in `randvars/_normal.py` the import reads

- `from ._randomvariables import RandomVariable`

which helps with making the code in `Normal` more compact and readable.

### Type Standardization

Many types representing numeric values, shapes, dtypes, random states, etc. have different
possible representations. For example a shape could be specified in the following ways: `n, (n,), (n, 1), [n], [n, 1]`.

For this reason most types should be standardized internally to a core set of types defined
in `probnum.type`, e.g. for numeric types `np.generic`, `np.ndarray`. Methods for input
argument standardization can be found in `probnum.utils.argutils`.

### Naming

The package itself is written "ProbNum" except when referred to as a package import, then `probnum` should be used.

#### Classes, Functions, Methods and Variables
- `joined_lower` for functions, methods, attributes, variables
- `joined_lower` or `ALL_CAPS` for constants
- `StudlyCaps` for classes
- `camelCase` only to conform to pre-existing conventions, e.g. in `unittest`

#### Probabilistic Numerical Methods
Function names and signatures of PN methods attempt to replicate `numpy` or `scipy` naming conventions.
For example
- `probsolve_ivp(...)` (scipy: `solve_ivp(...)`)
- `problinsolve(...)` (scipy: `linalg.solve(...)`)

Methods with "Bayesian" in the name come with the prefix `bayes`, e.g. `bayesquad`; Bayesian quadrature, `BayesFilter`; Bayesian filter, `BayesSmoother`; Bayesian smoother.

### Printable Representations

The way an object is represented in the console or printed is defined by the following functions:

- `repr(obj)` is defined by `obj.__repr__()` and should return a developer-friendly representation of `obj`. If possible,
this should be code that can recreate `obj`.
- `str(obj)` is defined by `obj.__str__()` and should return a user-friendly representation of `obj`. If no `.__str__()`
method is implemented, Python will fall back to the `.__repr__()` method.

As an example consider `numpy`'s array representation
```python
array([[1, 0],
       [0, 1]])
```
versus its output of `str`.
```python
[[1 0]
 [0 1]]
```

### Notational Conventions
Stick to the first few letters for abbreviations if they are sufficiently descriptive:
- `cov`: covariance
- `fun`: function
- `mat`: matrix
- `vec`: vector
- `arr`: array; wherever applicable, specify `vec` or `mat`

Further conventions are
- `unit2unit`: convert between types or units, e.g. `mat2arr`: convert matrix to array or `s2ms`: convert seconds to milliseconds. Can also be used for simple adapter methods, along the lines of `filt2odefilt`.
- `proj`: projection (if required: `projmat`, `projvec`, `projlinop`, ...)
- `precon`: preconditioner
- `driftmat`: drift-matrix, `forcevec`: force-vector, `dispmat` dispersion-matrix,
`dynamicsmat` dynamics-matrix, `diffmat` diffusion-matrix,
plus the respective `driftmatfun`, `driftfun`, `dispmatfun`, etc.
- `inv*`: for inverse of a matrix; e.g. `invprecond`, `invcovmat`, ...
- optional arguments via `**kwargs`, e.g.: `fun(t, x, **kwargs)`
- `msg`: message, e.g. for issuing raising and warnings (`errmsg`, `warnmsg`)
- `rv`: random variable; if concatenated with e.g. `init`, abbreviate to `initrv` (initial random variable)
- `data`: data (don't abbreviate that one)
- functions/methods that do something from time `t0` to time `t1`
  with step size `h` use the signature `(start, stop, step, **kwargs)`
  or any corresponding subset of that. This is in line with `np.arange`
  for instance. Use it like `(start=t0, stop=t1, step=h, **kwargs)`.
- `jacob`: Jacobian, if necessary use `jacobfun`. Hessians are `hess`, respectively
  `hessfun`.
- `param(s)`: parameter(s). If abbreviations are necessary
  (e.g. in inline-function definition, use `par(s)`).
- Indices via `idx` (either `idx1`, `idx2`, ... or `idx`, `jdx`, `kdx`)
  and not via `i, j, k`. The former is more readable (and follows PEP8);
  the latter may collide with the built-in imaginary constant `j=sqrt(-1)`.
- A function maps from its ``domain`` to its ``range``.
  The ``range`` of a random variable is the ``domain`` of its distribution.

### Errors and Warnings
- Stick to the built-in python exceptions (`TypeError`, `NotImplementedError`, ...)
- If dunder method is not implemented for a type, return `NotImplemented`
- Warnings via `warnings.warn()`. See https://docs.python.org/2/library/warnings.html
or https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.Warning.
- Recall the difference between `TypeError` and `ValueError`
    - `TypeError` Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a list when an
     int is expected) should result in a TypeError. Example: `float(['5
     '])` since a list cannot be converted to float.
    - `ValueError`: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument
     that has the right type but an inappropriate value. Example: The `float
     ` function can take a string, i.e. `float('5')`, but `float('string')` fails
      since `'string'` is a non-convertible string.

## Package Structure

### Modules and Folders
- `low` (shortened lower caps) for modules/folders in the namespace, e.g. `probnum.linalg.linops`
- `lower` for modules/folders not in the namespace, e.g. `probnum/linalg/linearsolvers`.
*Rule of thumb:* the more low-level the module is, the longer
(more descriptive) the file name can be, because the chances
that access is provided through higher-level namespaces are rather high.

Interfaces to PN methods should be in a separate module, while their implementation (in classes) is in the same folder in other files.

## Documentation

All documentation is written in American English. Every publicly visible class or function
must have a docstring. Do not use extensive documentation as a clutch for spaghetti code -- divide and conquer instead!
