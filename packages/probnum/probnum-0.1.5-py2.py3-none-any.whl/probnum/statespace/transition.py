class Transition(abc.ABC):
    r"""Interface for Markov transitions in discrete and continuous time.

    This framework describes transition probabilities

    .. math:: p(\mathcal{G}_t[x(t)] \,|\,  x(t))

    for some operator :math:`\mathcal{G}: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m`, which are used to describe the evolution of Markov processes

    .. math:: p(x(t+\Delta t) \,|\, x(t))

    both in discrete time (Markov chains) and in continuous time (Markov processes).
    In continuous time, Markov processes are modelled as the solution of a
    stochastic differential equation (SDE)

    .. math:: d x(t) = f(t, x(t)) d t + d w(t)

    driven by a Wiener process :math:`w`. In discrete time, Markov chain are
    described by a transformation

    .. math:: x({t + \Delta t})  \,|\, x(t) \sim p(x({t + \Delta t})  \,|\, x(t)).

    Sometimes, these can be equivalent. For example, linear, time-invariant SDEs
    have a mild solution that can be written as a discrete transition.
    In ProbNum, we also use discrete-time transition objects to describe observation models,

    .. math:: z_k \,|\, x(t_k) \sim p(z_k \,|\, x(t_k))

    for some :math:`k=0,...,K`. All three building blocks are used heavily in filtering and smoothing, as well as solving ODEs.

        compute_gain
            Flag that indicates whether the expected gain of the forward transition shall be computed. This is important if the forward-pass
            is computed as part of a forward-backward pass, as it is for instance the case in a Kalman update.
        _diffusion
            Special diffusion of the driving stochastic process, which is used internally.
        _linearise_at
            Specific point of linearisation for approximate forward passes (think: extended Kalman filtering). Used internally for iterated filtering and smoothing.

        Returns
        -------
        RandomVariable
            New state, after applying the forward-pass.
        Dict
            Information about the forward pass. Can for instance contain a `gain` key, if `compute_gain` was set to `True` (and if the transition supports this functionality).
