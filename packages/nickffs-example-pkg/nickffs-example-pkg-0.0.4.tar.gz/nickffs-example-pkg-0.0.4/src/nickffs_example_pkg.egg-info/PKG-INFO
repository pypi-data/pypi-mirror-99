        This is a basic template that I keep updated with PyPi packaging best practices in an effort to speed up the process of packaging my python based git repositories. I hope you find these of use to you. 
        
        This README.md file is also made as a general template so as to be useful for other projects.   
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install example-pkg.
        
        ```bash
        pip install example-pkg
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        # this is some python code.
