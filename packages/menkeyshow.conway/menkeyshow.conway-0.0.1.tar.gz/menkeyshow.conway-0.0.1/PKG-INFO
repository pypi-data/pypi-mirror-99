Description: # Conway's Game_of_Life
        Python implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
        
        Conway's Game of Life is an automaton simulation with rather simple rules and a so called zero-player game.
        After marking the status (alive/dead) of the cells, the programm simulates the life according to the following rules:
        
        <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
