    Stop runs currently in the "Running" state specified by RUN_IDS.

    A stopped run is sent a stop signal that ends current execution and
    transitions to the "Saving" state once the signal has been received. Stopped
    runs will execute any and all steps after being stopped, so a stopped run will,
    for example, execute both the "Pushing" and "Saving" steps after stopping.
    If "stop" is called on a run that has not yet entered the "Running" state, the
    run is killed (see documentation of "kill" for more details).
