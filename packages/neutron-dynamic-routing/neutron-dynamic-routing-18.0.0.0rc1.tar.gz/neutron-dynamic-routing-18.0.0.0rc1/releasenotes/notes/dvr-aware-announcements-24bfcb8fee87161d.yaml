    DVR-aware BGP announcements are now supported for IPv4. Host routes
    for instances are announced as /32 host routes, using the appropriate
    floating IP gateway port on the host as the next-hop. This allows
    network traffic to bypass the centralized router on the network
    node and ingress/egress directly on the compute node.
