    Currently freezer-api supports only elasticsearch as database engine.
    Elasticsearch is adding complexity in deploying and running freezer, the
    need and planning to move to sqlalchemy has been a moving target since Pike.

    Now freezer-api should be able to support sqlalchemy, it's still under
    development, so not fully supported yet. There is work in progress to unify
    the database api so freezer can support more than one database driver at
    the same time.

features:
  - |
    Freezer support for sqlalchemy in development.
    freezer-manage fully supports sqlalchemy database now!

issues:
  - |
    No Backward compitibility support!
    sqlalchemy will be only supported for freezer api version 2

critical:
  - |
    Freezer api version 1 is broken and won't be supported!

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed remove mappings in freezer-manage as elasticsearch removed this
    feature, so now we have to delete the index not individual mappings!
