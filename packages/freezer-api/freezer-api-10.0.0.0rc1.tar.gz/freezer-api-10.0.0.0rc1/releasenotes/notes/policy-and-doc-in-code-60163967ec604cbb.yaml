    Freezer now support policy in code, which means if users didn't modify
    any of policy rules, they can remove or comment out all of rules in
    policy file or even not deploy it at all. Because from now, Freezer
    keeps all default policies under `freezer-api/common/policies` module.
    Users can still modify/generate `policy.yaml` file which will override
    policy rules in code if those rules show in `policy.yaml` file.
