    Currently Freezer uses Elastic Search (ES) as a database backend, which
    is a NoSQL database specialized for ranked query results. Elastic Search
    adds additional complexity to an OpenStack system. Most of the OpenStack
    components use a relational database management system (DBMS like MySQL or
    PostgreSQL) which is more common. It is more familiar how to
    maintain, troubleshoot and develop on top of relational databases.
    Also relational databases unlike ES database allow to perform rolling
    upgrades.

    Since Freezer related data turned out to be relational, it would be more
    convenient to use it trough the oslo.db pattern library. Using it, the
    database mapping would be more uniform to other OpenStack projects.
    It would be less challenging for new developers to contribute.
