prelude: >
    Currently freezer-api v1 doesn't fully support multi-tenancy. In previous
    releases, we implemented oslo.policy to support multi-tenancy, but we need
    to add a new parameter to freezer-api which is the project_id. We need to
    modify the structure of freezer-api url so it accepts project_id parameter.
    Example of the old structure::
    http://host_ip_address:9090/v1/jobs

    Example of the new structure::
    http://host_ip_address:9090/v2/project_id/jobs

features:
  - |
    Added Freezer-api v2 which changes the structure of freezer-api urls to
    accept the newly added parameter, project_id.

    Fully support role based multi-tenancy with api v2.


issues:
  - |
    It might break the backward compatibility.

upgrade:
  - |
    List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.
deprecations:
  - |
    Freezer api v1 will be deprecated with Pike release. It will be supported
    for another release, then will be removed completely.
