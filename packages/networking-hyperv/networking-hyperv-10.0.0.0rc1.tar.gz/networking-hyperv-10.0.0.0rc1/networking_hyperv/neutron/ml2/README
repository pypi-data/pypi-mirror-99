Hyper-V Neutron Agent and ML2 Mechanism Driver for ML2 Plugin
=============================================================

This mechanism driver is used by ``neutron-server`` in order to bind neutron
ports to Hyper-V hosts. In order to use it, ``neutron-server`` must use the
Ml2Plugin as a ``core_plugin``. The service's configuration file
(``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf``), must contain this following line:

::

    core_plugin = neutron.plugins.ml2.plugin.Ml2Plugin

In order to use this ML2 Mechanism Driver, ``networking-hyperv`` must be
installed on the Neutron Controller:

::

    pip install networking-hyperv

Additionally, the ML2 Plugin must be configured to use the Hyper-V Mechanism
Driver, by adding it to the ``mechanism_drivers`` field in
``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini``:

::

    [ml2]
    mechanism_drivers = openvswitch,hyperv
    # any other mechanism_drivers can be added to the list.

After editing a configuration file, the ``neutron-server`` service must be
restarted, in order for the changes to take effect.

Currently, the mechanism driver supports the following network types: local,
flat, vlan, gre. Neutron ports on networks having other types than the ones
mentioned will not be bound on Hyper-V hosts.
