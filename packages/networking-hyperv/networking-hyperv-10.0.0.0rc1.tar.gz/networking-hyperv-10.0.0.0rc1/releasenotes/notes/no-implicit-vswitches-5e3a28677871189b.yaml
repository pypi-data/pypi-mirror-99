    The agents no longer use implicit/default vSwitches. The default 'private'
    local network vSwitch is no longer used and need to be explicitly
    configured. Also, in case of physical networks that are not included in
    the physical network mappings, the agent no longer attempts to implicitly
    use a vSwitch that has the same name.
