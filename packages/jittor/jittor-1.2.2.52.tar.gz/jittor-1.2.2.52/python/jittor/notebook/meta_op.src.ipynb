Broadcast, pad and slice operators are common reindex operators. And reduce, product and sum are common reindex-reduce operators. Element-wise operator is the third component of meta-operators. Compared to the first two, element-wise operators may contain multiple inputs. But all the input and output shapes of element-wise operators must be the same. And they are one-to-one mapped.
