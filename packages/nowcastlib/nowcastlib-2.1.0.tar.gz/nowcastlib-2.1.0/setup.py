    'long_description': '# Nowcast Library\n\n\U0001f9d9\u200d♂️🔧 Utils that can be reused and shared across and beyond the ESO Nowcast\nproject\n\nThis is a public repository hosted on GitHub via a push mirror setup in the\n[internal ESO GitLab repository](https://gitlab.eso.org/gstarace/nowcastlib/)\n\n## Installation\n\nSimply run\n\n```console\npip install nowcastlib\n```\n\n## Usage and Documentation\n\nAt the moment, Nowcast Library is simply a collection of functions. Here is a\nquick example of how one may import nowcastlib and get access to one of the\nfunctions:\n\n```python\n"""Example showing how to access compute_trig_fields function"""\nimport nowcastlib as ncl\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata_df = pd.DataFrame(\n    [[0, 3, 4, np.NaN], [32, 4, np.NaN, 4], [56, 8, 0, np.NaN]],\n    columns=["A", "B", "C"],\n    index=pd.date_range(start="1/1/2018", periods=4, freq="2min"),\n)\n\nresult = ncl.rawdata.compute_trig_fields(data_df, ["A", "C"])\n```\n\nAPI documentation can be found [here](https://giuliostarace.com/nowcastlib/).\n\nPlease refer to the\n[examples folder](https://github.com/thesofakillers/nowcastlib/examples/) on\nGitHub for example [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).\n\n## Development Setup\n\nThis repository relies on [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for tracking\ndependencies, building and publishing. It is therefore recommended that\ndevelopers [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and\nmake use of it throughout their development of the project.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nMake sure you are in the right Python environment and run\n\n```console\npoetry install\n```\n\nThis reads [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml), resolves the dependencies, and\ninstalls them.\n\n### Deployment\n\nThe repository is published to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), so to make it\naccessible via a `pip install` command as mentioned [earlier](#install).\n\nTo publish changes follow these steps. Ideally this process is automated via a\nCI tool triggered by a push/merge to the master branch:\n\n1. Optionally run\n   [`poetry version`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version) with the\n   appropriate argument based on [semver guidelines](https://semver.org/).\n\n2. Update the documentation by running\n\n   ```console\n   make document\n   ```\n\n3. Prepare the package by running\n\n   ```console\n   poetry build\n   ```\n\n4. Ensure you have [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/) and PyPi configured as\n   your poetry repositories:\n\n   ```console\n   poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n   poetry config repositories.pypi https://pypi.org/\n   ```\n\n5. Publish the repository to TestPyPi, to see that everything works as expected:\n\n   ```console\n   poetry publish -r testpypi\n   ```\n\n6. Stage, commit and push your changes (to master) with git.\n7. Publish the repository to PyPi:\n\n   ```console\n   poetry publish -r pypi\n   ```\n',
