About

`SPRING <http://sachse.fz-juelich.de/emspring/>`_ (**S** \ingle **P** \article **R** \econstruction from **I** \mages \
of k\ **N** \own **G** \eometry) is a single-particle based helical reconstruction package for electron \
cryo-micrographs and has been used to determine 3D structures of a variety of highly ordered and less ordered \
specimens. Spring provides the entire single-particle based work-flow required for helical reconstruction including:

* Classification

* Helical symmetry determination and refinement tools

* High-resolution structure refinement 

* Multi-symmetry structure refinement

Spring is still maintained in the `Sachse <http://sachse.fz-juelich.de>`_ lab at the
`Ernst-Ruska Centre <http://www.fz-juelich.de/er-c/er-c-3>`_ of the `Research Centre Juelich <http://www.fz-juelich.de>`_ for the Unix operating systems of MacOSX and Linux.

Spring is released under the modified BSD lisence and integrates several different electron-microscopy specific and \
other open-source packages. Spring is entirely written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ and is based on the EM \
functions and libraries of:

#. `EMAN2.91 <http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2>`_ 

#. `SPARX <http://sparx-em.org/sparxwiki/SparxWiki>`_

Dependencies
------------

Spring makes use of a number of scientific computing packages:

* `Numpy and Scipy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ 

* `Mpi4py <http://mpi4py.scipy.org>`_

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
