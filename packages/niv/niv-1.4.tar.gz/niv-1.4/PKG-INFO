Description: # Welcome to Network Infrastructure Visualization (NIV)
        
        NIV is a console application to visualize network infrastructure using YAML files.
        
        [Our presantation page](https://top.pages.gitlab.rlp.net/21s/niv/niv/pages/)
        
        Network diagrams are commonly drawn manually, using tools like Visio or Draw.io. This makes maintaining an up-to-date representation of dynamic network environments challenging.
        Currently, no modern tools appear to exist which can generate network drawings from code such as YAML. Such a machine readable format would allow administrators to  automate the visualization of a topology and to track document changes using version control.
        
        **Key goals**
        - High quality visualization wanted (for dashboards, presentations, scientific papers)
        - Use YAML for infrastructure description
        - Offline generation of SVG diagrams
        - Hyperlink to detailed view (e.g. zoom into port utilization)
        
        The documentation is split between the [Wiki](https://gitlab.rlp.net/top/21s/niv/niv/-/wikis/home) and [this repository](https://gitlab.rlp.net/top/21s/niv/niv):
        
        * Rather stable documentation parts tend to be saved in the [Wiki](https://gitlab.rlp.net/top/21s/niv/niv/-/wikis/home), which is also a git repository.
        * Rather short time documentation parts tend to be saved [here in this repository](https://gitlab.rlp.net/top/21s/niv/niv) in a semester oriented branch.
