A :class:`CeedStage` combines :mod:`ceed.shapes` on the screen with a
:mod:`ceed.function` which determines the intensity of the shape as time
progresses. This module defines the classes used to compute the
intensity values for the shapes during an experimental stage.

        A :class:`CeedStage` represents a collection of shapes with functions

        every time point. This iterator walks through time denoting the
        intensity for each shape for every time point.

        E.g. to get the shape values for time 0, .1, .2, ..., 1.0 for the

        on the iterator and then send the monotonically increasing time to
