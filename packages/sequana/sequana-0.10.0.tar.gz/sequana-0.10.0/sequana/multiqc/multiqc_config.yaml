# Example MultiQC Configuration File
#######################################

# This file can be saved either in the MultiQC installation
# directory, or as ~/.multiqc_config.yaml

# Configuration settings are taken from the following locations, in order:
# - Hardcoded in MultiQC (multiqc/utils/config.py)
# - <installation_dir>/multiqc_config.yaml
# - ~/.multiqc_config.yaml
# - Command line options

# Note that all of the values below are set to the MultiQC defaults.
# It's recommended that you delete any that you don't need.

# How to plot graphs. Different templates can override these settings, but
# the default template can use interactive plots (Javascript using HighCharts)

# to prevent the browser being locked up when the report opens.
