The `pypinex_pack` module provides support for compression and decompression by standard algorithms:

* gzip
* bzip2
* xz
* uploadpack

The basic concept: File-like data objects that are passed through such a processor will be treated as binary data providers. The binary content
these data objects provide will be read, compressed, and a new file-like object with the compressed data will be returned.
