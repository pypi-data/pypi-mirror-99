        For counting quotas--those quotas for which there is a usage

        current usage and the desired deltas.  The deltas are given as
        keyword arguments, and current usage and other reservations
        are factored into the quota check.

        This method will raise a QuotaResourceUnknown exception if a
        given resource is unknown or if it does not have a usage
        synchronization function.

        If any of the proposed values is over the defined quota, an
        OverQuota exception will be raised with the sorted list of the
        resources which are too high.  Otherwise, the method returns a
        list of reservation UUIDs which were created.

                       added to the current time.  A datetime.datetime
                       object will be interpreted as the absolute
