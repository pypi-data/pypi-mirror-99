    Intel OPAE driver dependency is removed from the devstack installation
    dependencies due to the following reasons:
    1) In the kolla cyborg-agent image we install OPAE, but OPAE is
    not available for CentOS 8 for the moment. This will make the cyborg-agent
    image unbuildable in Ussuri. 2) In devstack, due to the fact that OPAE
    packages depend on libjson0, which is not available after Ubuntu 16.04, so
    cyborg can't be installed on Ubuntu higher than 16.04 now(unless disable
    dependency manually). Moreover,from cyborg's perspective, it does not need
    to contain any hardware driver dependency, we can assume the admin should
    know about it and install the correct version.
