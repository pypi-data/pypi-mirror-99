    Cyborg now supports microversion in order to allow changes to the API while
    preserving backward compatibility. User requests must include an HTTP header
    ``OpenStack-API-Version: accelerator 2.0`` which is a monotonically increasing
    semantic version number starting from 2.0. If that header is absent, the
    request defaults to the default microverison 2.0.
