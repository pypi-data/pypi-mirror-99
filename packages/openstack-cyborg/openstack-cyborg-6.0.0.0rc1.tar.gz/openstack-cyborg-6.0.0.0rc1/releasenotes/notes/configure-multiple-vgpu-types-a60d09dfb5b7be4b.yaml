    The cyborg Nvidia GPU driver now supports defining different virtual GPU
    types for each physical GPU. See the ``[gpu_devices]/enabled_vgpu_types``
    configuration option for knowing how to do it. Please refer to
    https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/cyborg-specs/specs/wallaby/approved/vgpu-driver-proposal.html
    for further documentation.
