features:
  - |
    In the Victoria release, cyborg introduced the new scoped RBAC policy
    authorization for API access, and partially implemented the blueprints.
    What implemented are new default rules in base policy and device_profile
    policy.

    During the development period(victoria and wallaby releases), the new and
    old policy will both work because a deployment sets
    ``cyborg.conf [oslo_policy] enforce_scope = False`` as the default set.
    Although users can set ``cyborg.conf [oslo_policy] enforce_scope = True``
    by default in their deployment, if they want to ignore old rules and
    support new rules only. After we implement all the features, we'll give
    two cycles transition period for operators. For specification of
    new policy, please refer to `policy default refresh`_.

    - Scope

      Cyborg introduced ``scope_type`` to protect each policy. Cyborg support
      two types of ``sope_type`` with their combination. ``['system']``,
      ``['project']`` and ``['system', 'project']``.

      To know each policy ``scope_type``, please refer the `Policy Reference`_

      This feature is disabled by default can be enabled via config option
      ``[oslo_policy]enforce_scope`` in ``cyborg.conf``

      - New Defaults Configuration

      Policies are default to Admin, Member and Reader roles. Old roles
      are also supproted. You can switch to new defaults via config option
      ``[oslo_policy]enforce_new_defaults`` in ``cyborg.conf`` file.

    - New Base policy roles

      Cyborg introduced seven basic roles based on the new defaults combined
      with different scope_types.

      - project_reader
      - project_member
      - project_admin
      - system_admin
      - system_reader
      - system_admin_or_owner
      - system_or_project_reader

    - New Defaults for device_profile APIs

      Rewrite check string(authorization rules) using new personas for
      device profile APIs.

      Add ``checkstr=base.PROJECT_READER_OR_SYSTEM_READER`` and
      deprecated ``checkstr=base.deprecated_default`` for

      - ``cyborg:device_profile:get_one``
      - ``cyborg:device_profile:get_all``

      Add ``check_str=base.SYSTEM_ADMIN`` and
      deprecated ``check_str=base.deprecated_is_admin`` for

      - ``cyborg:device_profile:create``

      Add ``check_str=base.SYSTEM_ADMIN`` and
      deprecated ``base.deprecated_default`` for

      - ``cyborg:device_profile:delete``
