    The default value of ``[oslo_policy] policy_file`` config option has been
    changed from ``policy.json``
    to ``policy.yaml``. Cyborg policy new defaults since 5.0.0 and current
    default value of ``[oslo_policy] policy_file`` config option (``policy.json``)
    does not work when ``policy.json`` is generated by
    `oslopolicy-sample-generator <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/cli/oslopolicy-sample-generator.html>`_  tool.
    Refer to `bug 1875418 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1875418>`_
    for more details.
    Also check `oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/cli/oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml.html>`_
    tool to convert the JSON to YAML formatted policy file in
    backward compatible way.
