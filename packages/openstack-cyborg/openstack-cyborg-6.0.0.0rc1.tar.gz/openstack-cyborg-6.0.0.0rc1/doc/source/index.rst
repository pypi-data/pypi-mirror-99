Using the API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the Ussuri release, every Cyborg deployment should have the
following endpoints:

/ - list of available versions

/v2 - the version 2 of the Acceleration API, it uses microversions

/v2.0 - same API as v2, except uses microversions

The follwoing guide concentrates on documenting the v2 API, please note that
the v2.0 is the first microversion of the v2 API and are also covered by this
guide.

* `Cyborg API Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/accelerator/>`_:
  The complete reference for the accelerator API, including all methods and
  request / response parameters and their meaning.

.. # TODO(brinzhang): After completing the
   `Cyborg API v2 <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/cyborg-specs/specs/ussuri/implemented/cyborg-api.html>`_
   API, the "Cyborg API Microversion History <https://xxx>"" management
   document will be added, and it will also be added here.
