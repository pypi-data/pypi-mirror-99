=====================
Cyborg Support Matrix
=====================

Cyborg supports specific operations on VMs with attached accelerator
resources, which are generally a subset of the full set of VM operations
supported by Nova (`nova-vm-ops
<https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/server_concepts.html>`_).

In this release, these operations have a dependency on specific Nova
patches (`nova-patches
<https://review.opendev.org/#/q/status:open+project:openstack/nova+bp/nova-cyborg-interaction>`_).
They can be expected to work in Cyborg only
if and when these Nova patches get merged without significant changes.
These operations are not supported in this release since the dependencies
are not met.
