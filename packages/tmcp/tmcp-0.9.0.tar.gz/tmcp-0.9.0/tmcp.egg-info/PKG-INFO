        ## How to use
        
        Start by creating an instance of the TMCPHandler.
        You should pass in your agent.
        
        ```py
        from tmcp import TMCPHandler
        
        class MyBot(BaseAgent):
            def initialize_agent(self):
                self.tmcp_handler = TMCPHandler(self)
        ```
        
        Usage is also very straightforward:
        
        ```py
        from tmcp import TMCPMessage, ActionType
        
        ...
            def get_output(self, packet: GameTickPacket) -> SimpleControllerState:
                # Receive and parse all new matchcomms messages into TMCPMessage objects.
                new_messages: List[TMCPMessage] = self.tmcp_handler.recv()
                # Handle TMCPMessages.
                for message in new_messages:
                    if message.action_type == ActionType.BALL:
                        print(message.time)
                
                ...
        
                # You can send messages like this.
                self.tmcp_handler.send_boost_action(pad_index)
        
                # Or you can create them and send them more directly:
                my_message = TMCPMessage.ball_action(self.team, self.index, estimated_time_of_arrival)
                self.tmcp_handler.send(my_message)
        ```
        
        The handler will throttle your messages if you send them too quickly.
        If you want to make sure all of your messages are sent, you can create a backlog like this:
        
        ```py
        # During initialization, create a backlog list.
        self.backlog = []
        
        ...
        # Sending returns false if a message was not sent.
        if not self.tmcp_handler.send(message):
            self.backlog.append(message)
        
        ...
        # In your main loop, check whether you have any messages in the backlog.
        if self.backlog:
            backlog_message = self.backlog.pop(0)
            # Try sending the message again. If it doesn't work, return it to the backlog.
            if not self.tmcp_handler.send(backlog_message):
                self.backlog.insert(0, backlog_message)
        ```
        
        ## Avoiding breaking changes
        
        This package is regularly updated according to the latest TMCP specification.
        To avoid your bot breaking during tournaments, you can use a virtual_environment and pin a specific version of this package.
        
        In your requirements.txt:
        
        ```txt
        tmcp==0.9
        ```
        
        In your bot.cfg:
        
        ```toml
        [Locations]
        use_virtual_environment = true
        requirements_file = ./requirements.txt
        ```
        
        If you don't want to do this, you can also disable the handler if a different version of the package is used.
        This will not send or receive any messages, but will pretend as if it was sending all and receiving none.
        
        ```py
        from tmcp import TMCP_VERSION
        
        if TMCP_VERSION != [0, 9]:
            my_handler.disable()
        ```
