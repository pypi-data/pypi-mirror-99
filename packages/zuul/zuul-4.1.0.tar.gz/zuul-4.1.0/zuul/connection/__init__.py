    A connection is a shared object that sources, triggers and reporters can
    use to speak with a remote API without needing to establish a new

    Multiple instances of the same connection may exist with different
    credentials, for example, thus allowing for different pipelines to operate
    on different Gerrit installations or post back as a different user etc.

    Connections can implement their own public methods. Required connection
    methods are validated by the {trigger, source, reporter} they are loaded
    into. For example, a trigger will likely require some kind of query method
    while a reporter may need a review method."""
