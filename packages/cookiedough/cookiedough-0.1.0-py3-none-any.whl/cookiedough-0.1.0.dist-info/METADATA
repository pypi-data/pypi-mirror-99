[**cookiedough**(1)](https://fossil.include-once.org/cookiedough/file/manpage/cookiedough.md)
is a GUI browser for cookiecutter templates. And can of course extract them.
It comes with a database of around 2300 cookietemplates, grouped by category, and allows some
rudimentary filtering. Very **early alpha**, but usable.

# Installation / Use

Just install it as normal pip package:

    ~$   pip3 install -U cookiedough

And start it from a terminal window:

    ~/projects$   cookiedough

Keep an eye on the terminal when rolling out a template. Not all prompts
might be captured by monkeypatching.


# Notes

There's some usage information in the man page, and in the →Help→Help.


## Bugs / Caveats

 * No support for template dictionary variables. (They're not widely used though.)
 * No replay support yet.
 * Database does not contain any directoried templates yet. (A few exist however.)
 * The README colorization is fairly basic. (But more processsing would
   slow it down too much.)
 * It can crash when speed-scrolling through the templates. (Perhaps PSG
   vs Tk threads issue.)
 * Tkinter might also crash when encountering emojis. (Either install
   Symbola font and get rid of Noto Color Emoji. Or upgrade to tcl/tk
   8.6.10, or go back to Ubuntu 18.04 where it miraculously worked.)
