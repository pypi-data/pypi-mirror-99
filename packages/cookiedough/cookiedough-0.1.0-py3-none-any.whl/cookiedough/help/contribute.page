<title>How to contribute / ToDo</title>


<section>
 <title>Contributions</title>
 <p>This project hinges on an updated cookiecutters database. Unfortunately
 that's quite time-consuming. So new templates might not find their way
 in here - without feedback/submissions from authors.</p>

 <p>Not sure if there's enough interest, but this would require either
 automating the database build, or providing a submission API. Or both.</p>

 <list>
 <item><p>There's the <link type="seealso" href="https://fossil.include-once.org/cookiedough/wiki/dev">dev/ scripts</link>
 as basis.</p></item>
 <item><p>Ideally it would be rewritten to also support BitBucket/GitLab/etc.


 The lack of common API is a real showstopper though.</p></item>
 <item><p>(I don't blame GitHub alone.)</p></item>
 <item><p>And obviously there's no library that interfaces with all alike.</p></item>
 </list>
 <item><p>Wouldn't be too difficult to bring this into the GUI even. (Though it
 takes around half an hour to collect project repositories on GH.)</p></item>
</section>

<section>
 <subtitle>Submit API</subtitle>
 <list>
 <item><p>It might be easiest to query individual projects, and just provide a
 submission endpoint.</p></item>
 <item><p>The fossil repository is SQLite-based, so would allow nearby storage.</p></item>
 <item><p>Albeit you would still need a moderation step, rather than automatic
 updates for the main uidata.json.</p></item>
 <item><p>Or possibly just use the fossil ticket or forum feature.


 In which case, you could help out by reviewing/approving tickets.</p></item>

 <item><p>Read up on <link type="seealso" href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/quickstart.wiki">fossil usage</link>.</p></item>
 <item><p>It's significantly easier than git, and you can't easily break things.</p></item>

 <subtitle>Manual submissions</subtitle>
 <p>For now: you can send in a full JSON blob per email (see
 LICENSE), if you want your template be updated or added.</p>
