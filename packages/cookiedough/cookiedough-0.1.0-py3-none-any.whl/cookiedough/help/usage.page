<section>


 <p>Start cookiedough from the terminal, in your <code>~/projects</code> directory:</p>

 <code>$  cookiedough
 </code>

 <p>You can browse the tempalte list in the left pane. They're grouped
 by languages or application names. It's also possible to filter the
 list with the search box.</p>

 <p>The right hand white section is the content area, where details of
 the cookiecutter template are shown. Among there is the file list /
 directory structure, and a preview of the readme.</p>

 <p>Though you might often want to just hit the link to view the online
 version of the repository instead. Alterantively use →Template→Copy
 repo URL to utilize the URL to use with commandline cookiecutter.</p>

 <p>Hitting the Roll out button will start the creation
 process. (Though a template variables input window will appear
 beforehand.)</p>
