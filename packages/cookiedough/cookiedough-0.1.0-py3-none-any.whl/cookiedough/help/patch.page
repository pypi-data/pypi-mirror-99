 <title>Cookiecutter patch</title>


<section>
 <p>cookiedough provides a mneu option →File→Cookiecutter→Patch for XDG-compliance,
 which permanently fixes cookiecutters´ config module to use a <code>~/.config</code> path.</p>
 <list>
 <item><p>The new config filename will be <code>~/.config/cookiecutter/config</code>.</p></item>
 <item><p>It'll also move an existing cache and replay/ directories.</p></item>
 <item><p>Incurs a dependency on the <code>appdirs</code> package.</p></item>
 <item><p>Patch will create a <code>config.py.orig</code>, so it's easily reversible.</p></item>
 </list>
 <p>When used from within cookiedough, the old cookiecutter paths would be ignored
 in any case. (Fixated options). This patch is meant to bring CLI usage in line
 with GUI invocations.</p>

 <subtitle>The prophecy of a clutter-free homedir</subtitle>
 <p>System tools having a config file ~/.bashrc, ~/.ssh or even ~/.firefox directly
 in the homedir is perfectly fine. Special-purpose and rarely used development 
 tools are not entitled to such. And it went a little out of hand lately. (I blame
 git, as is custom.)</p>
 <p>User land applications should honor the XDG spec, APPDATA or whatever MacOS uses.
 And this includes CLI tools. Which is why cookiedough enforces it for cookiecutter.</p>
