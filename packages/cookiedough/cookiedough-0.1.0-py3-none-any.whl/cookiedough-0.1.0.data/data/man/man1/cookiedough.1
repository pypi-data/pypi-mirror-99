\f[B]cookiedough\f[R] [\f[I]\-\-debug\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION

templates.

.IP \[bu] 2
Meanwhile any update happens once you hit ENTER while the search box is
selected.
(Old mode / instant search is configurable, but slow.)
.IP \[bu] 2
You might want to search for common keywords in the description, or even
filenames (\f[C]pyproject.toml setup.cfg\f[R] etc.) to find matching
cookiecutters.
.SS Install
.IP \[bu] 2
Push the [Roll out] button top right.
.IP \[bu] 2
Input any of the default placeholder variables, or update existing
sample strings.
You usually want to leave any \f[C]{{expression...}}\f[R] as is.
.IP \[bu] 2
Verify the current working directory, then proceed.
.IP \[bu] 2
Yes/No prompts or additional inputs might come up if the template list
was outdated.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]WATCH OUT\f[R] for any prompts in the terminal window you started
cookiedough from.
Not all click prompts might get captured.
And obviously any error messages would gravitate there.
.SS Alternatives

Apart from opening the URL for a cookietemplate, there is also the
\[->]Template\[->]Copy repo URL option.
Which allows to combine CD and CLI usage.
