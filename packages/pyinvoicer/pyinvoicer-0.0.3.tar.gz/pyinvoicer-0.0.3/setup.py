No complicated setup like database is needed.\n\nQuick highlights:\n\n- run locally\n- content of input in YAML\n- output html and pdf\n- use as less third party dependency as possible\n\n\n![Invoice Screenshot Generated by PyInvoicer](./screenshot.png "Example Invoice").\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\nThe release has been tested with Python 3.9.1.\n\n### Installation\nThe tool has been released to PyPI. You can install it directly from PyPI via pip.\n\n```\npip install pyinvoicer\n```\n\nIf you want to install from the source, you may need `poetry`, the package dependency management tool.\nThis project is managed by `poetry`. Fetch the source and `poetry install`. See [Contributing](contributing.md) for\nmore details.\n\n\n## Usage\n```buildoutcfg\ninvoicer <your content yaml>\n```\n\nYou will get `invoice.pdf` in the same folder. The [examples](examples/simple-invoice.yaml) folder of the source\nshows an example of the content yaml.\n\n\n### Output in Different Format\nFor example, if you want to output your invoice in html, invoke:\n```buildoutcfg\ninvoicer <your content yaml> --format html\n```\n\n\n### Output with Customized Name and Path\n```buildoutcfg\ninvoicer <your content yaml> /path/you/want/to/use/your-invoice.pdf\n```\n\n\n### More Usage Options\nPlease refer to `invoicer --help`.\n\n\n## Contributing\nSee [Contributing](contributing.md)\n\n\n## Authors\nTaihsiang Ho (tai271828) <tai271828@gmail.com>\n\n\nCreated from [Lee-W/cookiecutter-python-template](https://github.com/Lee-W/cookiecutter-python-template/tree/0.7.2) version 0.7.2\n',
