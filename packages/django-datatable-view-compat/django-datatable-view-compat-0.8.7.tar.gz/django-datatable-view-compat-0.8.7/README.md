# Datatable View

This package is used in conjunction with the jQuery plugin [DataTables](http://datatables.net/), and supports state-saving detection with [fnSetFilteringDelay](http://datatables.net/plug-ins/api).  The package consists of a class-based view, and a small collection of utilities for rendering table data from models.

Dependencies:

* [dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil) library for flexible, fault-tolerant date parsing.
* [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) >= 2.0

# Update Note
This is a fork of the [0.8.3](https://github.com/pivotal-energy-solutions/django-datatable-view/tree/django-datatable-view-0.8.3) release
that has been updated to be compatible with Django >= 2.0.

This fork is useful if you would like to use django-datatable-view without jumping to the 0.9/1.0 release which has a number of changes
in the structure of `datatableview`. If you are starting out a new project, you are better off working with the 
[latest official release](https://github.com/pivotal-energy-solutions/django-datatable-view). 


# Features at a glance

* ``DatatableView``, a drop-in replacement for ``ListView`` that allows options to be specified for the datatable that will be rendered on the page.
* Verbose names as column headers
* Customizable table headers
* Compound columns (columns representing more than one model field)
* Columns backed by methods or callbacks instead of model fields
* Easy related fields
* Automatic searching support
* Ajax paging
* Zero queries on initial page load (no queryset evaluation is done until AJAX requests)
* Multiple tables on the same view
* Non-``DatatableView`` showing a table powered by another view
* 100% customization for all cell values
* Ajax search
* Search data fields that aren't present on the table
* Customization hook for each row's JSON object
* Customization hook for full JSON response object
* Drop-in x-editable support, per-column
* Customizable table templates
* Easy Bootstrap integration
* Allows all normal dataTables.js and x-editable Javascript options
* Javascript global object to do automatic or late initialization for tables
* Library of common column markup options
* Full test suite

# Demos & Examples
There is an example project wrapped up inside of the ``tests`` component of the resuable app, which
can be executed using the following basic setup:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/utapyngo/django-datatable-view.git
$ cd django-datatable-view
$ mkvirtualenv datatableview
(datatableview)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
(datatableview)$ datatableview/tests/example_project/manage.py migrate
(datatableview)$ datatableview/tests/example_project/manage.py runserver
```

The example project is configured to use a local sqlite3 database, and relies only on the ``django-datatable-view`` app itself.  In fact, it disables the normal ``django.contrib`` apps (except for ``django.contrib.staticfiles``, so that the dev server can serve the included statics) and disables all default middleware but the ``CommonMiddlware`` and ``CsrfViewMiddleware`` (the latter for supporting the x-editable demonstrations.)

A public online version of the example project can be found here:
