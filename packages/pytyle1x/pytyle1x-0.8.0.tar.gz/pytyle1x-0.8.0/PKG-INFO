Description: This is a fork of the [original PyTyle](http://github.com/BurntSushi/pytyle1),
        adjusted to work with Python 3.
        
        PyTyle is an extremely versatile and extensible tiling manager that is meant
        to be embedded into EWMH window managers. Its feature set was modeled after
        the basic tiling features of XMonad.
        
        Install with `pip install pytyle1x`. Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/programical/pytyle1x/wiki) for more details.
