        Lists entities observed within the specified timeframe along with their properties.

        :param entity_selector: Defines the scope of the query. Only entities matching the specified criteria are included into response.

            You need to set one of these criteria:

            Entity type: type("value").
            Dynatrace entity ID: entityId("id"). You can specify several IDs, separated by a comma (entityId("id-1","id-2")).

            And you can add one or several of the following criteria:

            Tag: tag("value"). Tags in [context]key:value, key:value, and value formats are detected and parsed automatically.
            If a value-only tag has a colon (:) in it, you must escape the colon with a backslash \\.
            Otherwise, the tag will be parsed as a key:value tag. All tag values are case-sensitive.
            Management zone ID: mzId("ID")
            Management zone name: mzName("value"). Management zone names are case-sensitive.
            Dynatrace entity name: entityName("value"). You can specify several entity names, separated by a comma (entityName("name-1","name-2")).
            Entity names are case-sensitive.
            Health state (HEALTHY,UNHEALTHY): healthState("HEALTHY")

            Further information can be found at https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/entity-v2/.
            To set several criteria, separate them with a comma (,). For example, type("HOST"),healthState("HEALTHY").
            Only results matching all criteria are included in response.

            The length of the string is limited to 10,000 characters.

            The field is required when you're querying the first page of results.

        :param time_from: The start of the requested timeframe.

            You can use one of the following formats:

            Timestamp in UTC milliseconds.
            Human-readable format of 2019-12-21T05:57:01.123+01:00. If no time zone is specified, UTC is used. You can use a space character instead of the T. Seconds and fractions of a second are optional.
            Relative timeframe, back from now. The format is now-NU/A, where N is the amount of time, U is the unit of time, and A is an alignment. For example, now-1y/w is one year back, aligned by a week. The alignment rounds to the past. Supported time units for the relative timeframe are:
            m: minutes
            h: hours
