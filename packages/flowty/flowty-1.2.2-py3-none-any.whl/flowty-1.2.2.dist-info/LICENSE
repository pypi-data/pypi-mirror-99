TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. The "Program" means the modules of the Flowty network optimization
   optimization software.
2. The license is a nonexclusive software end user license, according to which
   the licensee is entitled to use an object code copy of the licensed software
   for commercial as well as non-commercial purposes.
3. The licensee acquires the right to use the delivered (downloaded) object
   code copy of the Program only and does not acquire any rights of ownership.
4. The licensee shall be prohibited from sublicensing and otherwise letting
   third parties use the Program without prior written consent from the
   licensor.
5. The licensee shall not be entitled to modify, reverse engineer, disassemble
   or decompile the Program. The licensee shall only be entitled to make copies
   of the Program for backup purposes.
6. The licensee is not required to accept this license, since the licensee has
   not signed it. However, nothing else grants the licensee permission to use
   the Program. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
   license. Therefore, by using the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
   you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its 
   terms and conditions for the Program or works based on it.

NO WARRANTY

7. Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for 
   the program to the extent permitted by applicable law. The
   copyright holders provide the program "as is" without warranty of any 
   kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
   implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is
   with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all 
   necessary servicing, repair, or correction. 
8. In no event will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify 
   and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to
   you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or 
   consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the 
   program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered 
   inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the
   program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other 
   party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
