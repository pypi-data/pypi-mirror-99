## RATPY: Pythonic RATS Data Visualiser

-----

## What is it?

------
**ratpy** is a python program which leverages plotly, dash
and a number of other dependencies to provide a platform for 
the visualisation of RATS files produced by next-generation 
Waters MS instrumentation. 

This module is not designed for public use and, indeed, would 
likely not be useful to anyone who doesn't have understanding of 
RATS or RATS files. Nevertheless, it is hosted here in case the 
use of this app becomes useful for developers or tinkerers
in the future. It's not impossible that the MS community will find
it useful.

**ratpy** may not be useful forever. as of 2021, it is useful to
Waters employees who work with RATS data but this will likely change
over the years.
