# Performance requirements:
# Molecule:
# * moving/rotating molecule is fast
# * lookup if pos in molecule is fast
# * lookup if molecule in an output zone is fast
# * (Nice-to-have) Isomorphism algorithm is easy to implement

# Molecule internal struct candidates:
# * direct grid pos-atom dict: O(1) lookup by pos
# * internal positions, with one map from an internal atom's position/direction to a grid
#   position/direction for reference: O(1) lookup, but a lot of overhead. Seemed to be
#   slower in practice.
#   * Only need to update one position and direction on move/rotate

# Reactor.molecules:
# * Molecules are ordered by last creation/modification
#   Used By: compliance with spacechem hidden priorities (output order)
# * Molecules container has fast add/delete (dict? If so, ensure __hash__ is left
#   as the default implementation which just checks object identity)
#   Used By: input, output, bond+, bond-
# * molecules can be quickly looked up by a single grid position
#   Used By: grab, bond+, bond-, fuse, etc.

# Reactor molecules container candidates:
# * dict + a posn to molecule dict: adds more memory than single dict, but allows O(1) lookup by pos
#   * moving a molecule now has overhead equal to it size... but if it speeds up collision checks it's
#     probably worth it, not to mention commands like bond+, fuse.
# * dict +: ordered, O(1) add/delete, O(N) lookup by pos (assuming O(1) pos lookup on Molecule)
# * list -: ordered, saves memory, O(1) add, O(N) delete, O(N) lookup by pos
