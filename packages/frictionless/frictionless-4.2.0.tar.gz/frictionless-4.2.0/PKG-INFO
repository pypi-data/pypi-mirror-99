        Frictionless is a framework to describe, extract, validate, and transform tabular data (DEVT Framework). It supports a great deal of data schemes and formats, as well as provides popular platforms integrations. The framework is powered by the lightweight yet comprehensive [Frictionless Data Specifications](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/).
        
        ## Purpose
        
        - **Describe your data**: You can infer, edit and save metadata of your data tables. It's a first step for ensuring data quality and usability. Frictionless metadata includes general information about your data like textual description, as well as, field types and other tabular data details.
        - **Extract your data**: You can read your data using a unified tabular interface. Data quality and consistency are guaranteed by a schema. Frictionless supports various file schemes like HTTP, FTP, and S3 and data formats like CSV, XLS, JSON, SQL, and others.
        - **Validate your data**: You can validate data tables, resources, and datasets. Frictionless generates a unified validation report, as well as supports a lot of options to customize the validation process.
        - **Transform your data**: You can clean, reshape, and transfer your data tables and datasets. Frictionless provides a pipeline capability and a lower-level interface to work with the data.
