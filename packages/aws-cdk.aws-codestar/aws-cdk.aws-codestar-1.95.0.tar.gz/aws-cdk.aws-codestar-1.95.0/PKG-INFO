        ## GitHub Repository
        
        To create a new GitHub Repository and commit the assets from S3 bucket into the repository after it is created:
        
        ```python
        # Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
        import aws_cdk.aws_codestar as codestar
        import aws_cdk.aws_s3 as s3
        
        codestar.GitHubRepository(stack, "GitHubRepo",
            owner="aws",
            repository_name="aws-cdk",
            access_token=cdk.SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token",
                json_field="token"
            ),
            contents_bucket=s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(stack, "Bucket", "bucket-name"),
            contents_key="import.zip"
        )
        ```
        
        ## Update or Delete the GitHubRepository
        
        At this moment, updates to the `GitHubRepository` are not supported and the repository will not be deleted upon the deletion of the CloudFormation stack. You will need to update or delete the GitHub repository manually.
