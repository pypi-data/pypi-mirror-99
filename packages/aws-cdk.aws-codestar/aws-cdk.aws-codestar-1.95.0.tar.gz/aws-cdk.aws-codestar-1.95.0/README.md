## GitHub Repository

To create a new GitHub Repository and commit the assets from S3 bucket into the repository after it is created:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_codestar as codestar
import aws_cdk.aws_s3 as s3

codestar.GitHubRepository(stack, "GitHubRepo",
    owner="aws",
    repository_name="aws-cdk",
    access_token=cdk.SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token",
        json_field="token"
    ),
    contents_bucket=s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(stack, "Bucket", "bucket-name"),
    contents_key="import.zip"
)
```

## Update or Delete the GitHubRepository

At this moment, updates to the `GitHubRepository` are not supported and the repository will not be deleted upon the deletion of the CloudFormation stack. You will need to update or delete the GitHub repository manually.
