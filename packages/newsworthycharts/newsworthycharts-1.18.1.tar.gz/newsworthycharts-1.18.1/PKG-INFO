Description: This  module contains methods for producing graphs and publishing them on Amazon S3, or in the location of your choice.
        
        It is written and maintained for `Newsworthy <https://www.newsworthy.se/en/>`_, but could possibly come in handy for other people as well.

        Installing
        ----------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          pip install newsworthycharts
        
        
        Using
        -----
        
        This module comes with two classes, `Chart` and `Storage` (and it's subclasses).
        When using the Chart class, the generated chart will be saved as a local file:
        
        .. code-block:: python3
        
          from newsworthycharts import SerialChart as Chart
        
        
          c = Chart(600, 800)
          c.title = "Number of smiles per second"
          c.xlabel = "Time"
          c.ylabel = "Smiles"
          c.caption = "Source: Ministry of smiles."
          data_serie_1 = [("2008-01-01", 6.1), ("2009-01-01", 5.9), ("2010-01-01", 6.8)]
          c.data.append(data_serie_1)
          c.highlight = "2010-01-01"
          c.render("test", "png")
        
        You can use a _storage_ object to save file to
        a specific location or cloud service:
        
        .. code-block:: python3
        
          from newsworthycharts import Chart
          from newsworthycharts import S3Storage
        
          s3 = S3Storage("my_bucket")
          c = Chart(600, 800, storage=s3)
          c.title = "Number of smiles per second"
          c.subtitle = "This chart tells you something very important."
          c.xlabel = "Time"
          c.ylabel = "Smiles"
          c.note = "There are some missing smiles in data"
          c.caption = "Source: Ministry of smiles."
          c.render("test", "png")
        
        
        To store a file in a local folder, use the `LocalStorage` class:
        
        .. code-block:: python3
        
          from newsworthycharts import LocalStorage
        
          storage = LocalStorage("/path/to/generated/charts")
        
        Charts are styled using built-in or user-defined styles:
        
        .. code-block:: python3
        
          from newsworthycharts import Chart
        
          # This chart has the newsworthy default style
          c = Chart(600, 800, style="newsworthy")
        
          # Style can also be the path to a style file (absolute or relative to current working directory)
          c2 = Chart(600, 800, style="path/to/styles/mystyle.mplstyle")
        
        To set up you own style, copy the build-in default: <https://github.com/jplusplus/newsworthycharts/blob/master/newsworthycharts/rc/newsworthy>
        
        Newsworthycharts will look first among the predefined style files for the requested style, so if you have a custom style file in you working directory you need to give it a unique name not already in use.
        
        Developing
        ----------
        
        To run tests:
        
        .. code-block:: python3
        
          python3 -m flake8
          python3 -m pytest
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        To deploy a new version to PyPi:
        
        1. Update Changelog below.
        2. Update `version.py`
        3. Build: `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
        4. Upload: `python3 -m twine upload dist/newsworthycharts-X.Y.X*`
        
        ...assuming you have Twine installed (`pip install twine`) and configured.

        - 1.2.1
        
          - Use strong color if there is nothing to highlight.
        
        - 1.2.0
        
          - Fix a bug where `decimals` setting was not used in all annotations. Potentially breaking in some implementations.

        - 1.1.4
        
          - Require Matplotlib < 3, because we are still relying on some features that are deprecated there. Also, internal changes to Matplot lib may cause some charts to look different depending on version.
        
        - 1.1.3
        
          - Make annotation use default font size, as relative sizing didn't work here anyway
        
        - 1.1.2
        
          - Move class properties to method properties to make sure multiple Chart instances work as intended/documented. This will make tests run again.
          - None values in bar charts are not annotated (trying to annotate None values used to result in a crash)
          - More tests
        
        - 1.1.1
        
          - Annotations should now work as expected on series with missing data
        
        - 1.1.0
        
          - Fix bug where decimal setting wasn't always respected
          - Make no decimals the default if unit is "count"
        
        - 1.0.0
