class RegisterBlock(Generic[BlockType], ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for collections of registers that represent distinct
    features of an I2C device. A RegisterBlock translates between high-level
    data structures and the low-level representation of that data as expressed
    by RegisterParsers. For example, for the DS series RTCs, there are sub-
    classes of RegisterBlock for the clock, the alarms, and their configuration
    states. The Clock subclass encapsulates RegisterParsers for the BCD-ish
    encoding of the Hour, Minute, Second, etc. stored in the device registers.

    RegisterBlock is a Generic type. When subclassing, add the appropriate type
    for the value represented by the subclass to its signature:

      class TimekeepingRegisterBlock(RegisterBlock[datetime]): ...

    A RegisterBlock subclass should define one or more attributes that are
    RegisterParsers. Subclasses must also define two methods:

     1) `_value` to read the data from its attributes and produce a value of
        the designated type
     2) `_prepare_update` to set its attributes to a given value

    For example, suppose some device stored a positive decimal number like
    12.34 with the integer part in register 0x00 and the fractional part in
    register 0x01, each represented as 2 digit standard BCD. You want to read
    or write this value as a 2-tuple of ints. A RegisterBlock for accessing
    this number could be:

        class DecimalRegisterBlock(RegisterBlock[Tuple[int, int]]):
            integer_part = BCDRegisterParser(0x00)
            fractional_part = BCDRegisterParser(0x01)

            def _value(self) -> Tuple[int, int]:
                return self.integer_part, self.fractional_part

            def _prepare_update(self, value: Tuple[int, int]) -> None:
                self.integer_part, self.fractional_part = value

        It is important for all RegisterParser instances to have a shared
        register state (i.e. the state stored in this class) in order to avoid
        mistakes if the state changes during a read. For example, if an RTC's
        Second register is read at 0 minutes 59 seconds, and then the clock
        ticks before we read the Minute register, the time would come out as
        1 minute 59 seconds. Maxim DS RTCs (and probably others) use of 2 sets
        of registers to prevent this issue from affecting I2C block reads, so
        we just need to make sure we only make one call to `read_registers()`
