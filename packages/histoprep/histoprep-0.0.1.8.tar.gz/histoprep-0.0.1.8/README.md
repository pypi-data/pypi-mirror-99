## Description

This module allows you to easily **cut** and **preprocess** large histological slides.

- Cut tiles from large slide images.
- Dearray TMA spots (and cut tiles from individual spots).
- Preprocess extracted tiles **easily**.

![workflow](./docs/_static/workflow.jpeg)


## Installation

First install `OpenCV` and `OpenSlide` on your system (instructions [here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/d3d/tutorial_general_install.html) and [here](https://openslide.org/download/)).

```bash 
pip install histoprep
```

Detailed installation instructions can be found from `HistoPrep` [docs](https://histoprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). 

## How To Use

``HistoPrep`` has a few simple commands that do most of the heavy lifting.

```python
import histoprep as hp

# Cutting tiles is done with two lines of
cutter = hp.Cutter('/path/to/slide', width=512, overlap=0.25, max_background=0.7)
metadata = cutter.save('/path/to/output_folder')
```

If you have many slides to process, you can also use `HistoPrep` as an excecutable for easy cutting.

```bash
python3 path/to/HistoPrep cut ./input_dir ./output_dir --width 512 --overlap 0.25 --img_type jpeg
```


After the tiles have been saved, preprocessing is just a simple outlier detection from the preprocessing metrics saved in `metadata`!

```python
from histoprep import preprocess

all_metadata = preprocess.collect_metadata('/path/to/output_folder')

blurry_tiles = all_metadata['sharpness'] < 10
pen_markings = all_metadata['hue_0.1'] < 120
weird_blue_shit = all_metadata['blue_0.05'] > 160
```

## Examples

Detailed examples can be found in the [docs](https://histoprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or the [examples](./examples) folder.

## What's coming?

`HistoPrep` is under constant development. If there are some features you would like to be added, just submit an [issue](https://github.com/jopo666/HistoPrep/issues) and we'll start working on the feature!

#### Requested features:

- [ ] Cutting and preprocessing for multichannel images (currently supports only `RGB`-images).
  - coming in version `0.0.2`.
- [x] ``Labeler`` class for easily labeling extracted tiles.
  - coming in version `0.0.2`.
- [ ] Add automatic detection of outliers from `metadata`.
  - This could be implemented with dimensionality reduction.
