        PyLipID is a python library for analyzing lipid interactions with membrane proteins from
        Molecular Dynamics Simulations. PyLipID has the following main features, please check out
        the tutorials for examples and the documentations for the API functionalities:
        
            * Analysis of lipid interactions with protein residues using a couple of metrics.
            * Detection of binding sites via calculating community structures in the interactions networks.
            * Analysis of lipid interactions with binding sites using a couple of metrics.
            * Calculation of lipid koff and residence time for protein residues and binding sites.
            * Generation of representative bound poses for binding sites.
            * Analysis of bound poses for binding sites via automated clustering scheme.
            * Adoption of a dual-cutoff scheme to overcome the 'cage-rattling' effect of coarse-grained simulations.
            * Generation of manuscript-ready figures for analysis.
        
        PyLipID can be used from Jupyter (former IPython, recommended), or by writing Python scripts.
        The documentaion and tutorials can be found at `pylipid.readthedocs.io <https://pylipid.readthedocs.io>`_.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install the PyLipID Python package, you need a few Python package dependencies which is listed in the
        `requirement.txt` file.
        
        If these dependencies are not available in their required versions, the installation will fail. We thus
        recommend using the package installer pip:
        
        ``pip install pylipid``
        
        If you know what you are doing and want to build from the source, the package is also available for
        download on Github via:
        
        ``git clone https://github.com/wlsong/PyLipID``
