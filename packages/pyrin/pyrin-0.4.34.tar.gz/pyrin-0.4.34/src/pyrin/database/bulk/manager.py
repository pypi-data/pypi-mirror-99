                            B entities in A will also be included in the result dict.
                            actually, `depth` specifies that relationships in an
                            entity should be followed by how much depth.
                            note that, if `columns` is also provided, it is required to
                            specify relationship property names in provided columns.
                            otherwise they won't be included even if `depth` is provided.
                            defaults to `default_depth` value of database config store.
                            please be careful on increasing `depth`, it could fail
                            application if set to higher values. choose it wisely.
                            normally the maximum acceptable `depth` would be 2 or 3.
                            there is a hard limit for max valid `depth` which is set
                            in `ConverterMixin.MAX_DEPTH` class variable. providing higher
                            `depth` value than this limit, will cause an error.

                            in result dict, but if `depth=1` is provided, then all
                            B entities in A will also be included in the result dict.
                            actually, `depth` specifies that relationships in an
                            entity should be followed by how much depth.
                            note that, if `columns` is also provided, it is required to
                            specify relationship property names in provided columns.
                            otherwise they won't be included even if `depth` is provided.
                            defaults to `default_depth` value of database config store.
                            please be careful on increasing `depth`, it could fail
                            application if set to higher values. choose it wisely.
                            normally the maximum acceptable `depth` would be 2 or 3.
                            there is a hard limit for max valid `depth` which is set
                            in `ConverterMixin.MAX_DEPTH` class variable. providing higher
                            `depth` value than this limit, will cause an error.
