class atomic_context(TransactionalContextManagerBase):
    """
    atomic context manager to make a code block execution atomic.

    meaning that before starting the execution of the code, a new session with a
    new transaction will be started, and after the completion of that code, if it
    was successful, the new transaction will be committed or if it was not successful
    the new transaction will be rolled back without the consideration or affecting the
    parent transaction which by default is scoped to request. the corresponding new
    session will also be removed after code execution.

    note that you *should not* commit, flush or rollback the transaction inside
    the current context. the context manager itself will do it automatically.
    if you do commit, flush or rollback manually, unexpected behaviors may occur.

    also note that you *should not* remove the corresponding session from session factory
    when using `atomic_context`. the removal operation will be handled by context manager
    itself and if you remove session manually, it will cause broken chain of sessions
    and unexpected behaviour.

    this context manager also supports multiple `atomic_context` usage in a single
    call hierarchy.

    for example:

    def service_root():
        store = get_current_store()
        value = EntityRoot()
        store.add(value)
        service_a()

    def service_a():
        with atomic_context() as store:
            value = EntityA()
            store.add(value)
            service_b()
            raise Exception()

    def service_b():
        with atomic_context() as store:
            value = EntityB()
            store.add(value)
            service_c()

    def service_c():
        with atomic_context():
            value = EntityC()
            value.save()

    in the above example, if the call hierarchy starts with `service_root()`, at
    the end, the data of `service_c` and `service_b` will be persisted into database.
    but the data of `service_a` and `service_root` will not be persisted because
    `service_a` raises an error before finish.

    nested context manager to make a code block executed in nested transaction.

    meaning that before starting the execution of the code, a new nested transaction

    the nested transaction will be rolled back without the consideration or affecting
    the parent transaction which by default is scoped to request.

    note that in nested transactions, the parent transaction must be committed to persist
    generated data during nested transaction, so committing the nested transaction itself,
    does not persist anything, it just releases the savepoint. if you want an independent
    transaction from parent that could commit its own changes on its own, use `atomic_context`.

    meaning that before starting the execution of the code, a new subtransaction
    will be started, and after the completion of that code, if it was not successful
    the subtransaction will be rolled back and it will also force the parent transaction
    which by default is scoped to request to be rolled backed.

    note that in subtransactions, the parent transaction must be committed to persist
