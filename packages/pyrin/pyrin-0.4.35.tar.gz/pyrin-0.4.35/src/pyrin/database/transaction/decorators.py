def atomic(func):
    """
    decorator to make a function execution atomic.

    meaning that before starting the execution of the function, a new session with a
    new transaction will be started, and after the completion of that function, if it
    was successful, the new transaction will be committed or if it was not successful
    the new transaction will be rolled back without the consideration or affecting the
    parent transaction which by default is scoped to request. the corresponding new
    session will also be removed after function execution.

    note that you *should not* commit, flush or rollback anything inside an atomic
    function, the `@atomic` decorator will handle commit, flush or rollback operations
    when needed. otherwise, unexpected behaviors may occur.

    also note that you *should not* remove the corresponding session from session factory
    when using `@atomic` decorator. the removal operation will be handled by decorator
    itself and if you remove session manually, it will cause broken chain of sessions
    and unexpected behaviour.

    this decorator also supports multiple `@atomic` usage in a single call hierarchy.
    for example:

    def service_root():
        store = get_current_store()
        value = EntityRoot()
        store.add(value)
        service_a()

    @atomic
    def service_a():
        store = get_current_store()
        value = EntityA()
        store.add(value)
        service_b()
        raise Exception()

    @atomic
    def service_b():
        store = get_current_store()
        value = EntityB()
        store.add(value)
        service_c()

    @atomic
    def service_c():
        value = EntityC()
        value.save()

    in the above example, if the call hierarchy starts with `service_root()`, at
    the end, the data of `service_c` and `service_b` will be persisted into database.
    but the data of `service_a` and `service_root` will not be persisted because
    `service_a` raises an error before finish.

    the parent transaction which by default is scoped to request.

    note that in nested transactions, the parent transaction must be committed to persist
    generated data during nested transaction, so committing the nested transaction itself,
    does not persist anything, it just releases the savepoint. if you want an independent
    transaction from parent that could commit its own changes on its own, use `@atomic`
    decorator.

    note that you *should not* commit, flush or rollback anything inside a nested
