# Python Wrapper for Unifi Protect API

This module communicates with Unifi Protect Surveilance software installed on either a Ubiquiti CloudKey+ or Unifi Dream Machine Pro.

The API is not documented by Ubiquiti, so there might be misses and/or frequent changes in this module, as Ubiquiti evolves the software.

The module is written for the sole purpose as being used in Home Assistant for the Custom Integration called *unifiprotect* but might be used for other purposes also.
