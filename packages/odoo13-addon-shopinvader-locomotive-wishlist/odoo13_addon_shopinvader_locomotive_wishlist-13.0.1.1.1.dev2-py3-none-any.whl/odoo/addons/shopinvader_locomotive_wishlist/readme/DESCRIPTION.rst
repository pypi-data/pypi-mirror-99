Export wihslist data to Locomotive user.

This module is mandatory if you want wishlists to work properly on Locomotive
otherwise there's no way to determine if a product is included in a wihslist or not
without having to contact Odoo.

See https://github.com/shopinvader/odoo-shopinvader/issues/574.
