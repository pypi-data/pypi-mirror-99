## Summary
**Requests-cache** is a transparent persistent HTTP cache for the python [requests](http://python-requests.org)
library. It is especially useful for web scraping, consuming REST APIs, slow or rate-limited
sites, or any other scenario in which you're making lots of requests that are likely to be sent
more than once.

Several storage backends are included: **SQLite**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, and **DynamoDB**.

See full project documentation at: https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io

## Installation
Install with pip:
```bash
pip install requests-cache
```

Requirements:
Requires python 3.6+.
You may need additional dependencies depending on which backend you want to use.
To install with extra dependencies for all supported backends:
```bash
pip install requests-cache[backends]
```

See [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for setup info for local development.

## Full Examples
* You can find a working example at Real Python:
[Caching External API Requests](https://realpython.com/blog/python/caching-external-api-requests)
* There are some additional examples in the [examples/](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/tree/master/examples) folder

## General Usage
There are two main ways of using `requests-cache`:
* Using [CachedSession](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#requests_cache.core.CachedSession) (recommended)
* Globally patching `requests` using [install_cache](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#requests_cache.core.install_cache)

### Sessions
`CachedSession` wraps `requests.Session` with caching features, and otherwise behaves the same as a
normal session.

Basic example:
```python
from requests_cache import CachedSession

session = CachedSession('demo_cache', backend='sqlite')
for i in range(100):
    session.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/1')
```
The URL in this example adds a delay of 1 second, but all 100 requests will complete in just over 1
second. The response will be fetched once, saved to `demo_cache.sqlite`, and subsequent requests
will return the cached response near-instantly.

There are many ways to customize caching behavior; see
[Advanced Usage](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_usage.html) for details.

### Patching
Patching with `requests_cache.install_cache()` will add caching to all `requests` functions:
```python
import requests
import requests_cache

requests_cache.install_cache()
requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
session = requests.Session()
session.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
```

`install_cache()` takes all the same parameters as `CachedSession`. It can be temporarily disabled
with `disabled()`, and completely removed with `uninstall_cache()`:
```python
# Neither of these requests will use the cache
with requests_cache.disabled():
    requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get')

requests_cache.uninstall_cache()
requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get')
```

**Limitations:**

Like any other utility that uses global patching, there are some scenarios where you won't want to
use this:
* In a multi-threaded or multiprocess applications
* In an application that uses other packages that extend or modify `requests.Session`
* In a package that will be used by other packages or applications

### Cache Backends
Several cache backends are included, which can be selected with the `backend` parameter to
`CachedSession` or `install_cache()`:

* `'memory'` : Not persistent, just stores responses with an in-memory dict
* `'sqlite'` : [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database (**default**)
* `'redis'` : [Redis](https://redis.io/) cache (requires `redis`)
* `'mongodb'` : [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database (requires `pymongo`)
* `'dynamodb'` : [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) database (requires `boto3`)

### Cache Expiration
By default, cached responses will be stored indefinitely. There are a number of ways you can handle
cache expiration. The simplest is using the `expire_after` param with a value in seconds:
```python
# Expire after 30 seconds
session = CachedSession(expire_after=30)
```

Or a `timedelta`:
```python
from datetime import timedelta

# Expire after 30 days
session = CachedSession(expire_after=timedelta(days=30))
```

You can also set expiration on a per-request basis, which will override any session settings:
```python
# Expire after 6 minutes
session.get('http://httpbin.org/get', expire_after=360)
```

If a per-session expiration is set but you want to temporarily disable it, use ```-1```:
```python
# Never expire
session.get('http://httpbin.org/get', expire_after=-1)
```

For better performance, expired responses won't be removed immediately, but will be removed
(or replaced) the next time they are accessed. To manually clear all expired responses:
```python
session.remove_expired_responses()
```
Or, when using patching:
```python
requests_cache.remove_expired_responses()
```

Or, to revalidate the cache with a new expiration:
```python
session.remove_expired_responses(expire_after=360)
```
