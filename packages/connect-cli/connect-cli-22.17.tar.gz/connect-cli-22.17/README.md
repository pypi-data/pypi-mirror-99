## Introduction

The CloudBlue Connect Command Line Interface (CLI) is an extensible unified tool to perform various automation scenarios. With just one tool, you can control multiple Connect modules from the command line and automate them through scripts.

Since it is extensible, user can write your own plugins to extend its functionalities.
