History and Road Map
====================

Past
----

2015
^^^^

* November: First implementation, simple data types, simple GUI

2016
^^^^

* February: Implemented selection (the same item gets selected in all trees, changing a tab shows the same item)
* March: Implemented remaining local functionality (Copy Branch as Sibling, Copy Children to Siblings, Remove from this Tree, Delete Item)
* August: Created installable python package

2017
^^^^

* May: Implemented new field type *text*
* June: Create deployable packages for Linux and Windows
* June: Made **pre-release v0.0** available
* October: Implemented new field type *node-path*, re-wrote the way nodes move to new parents
* November: Uploaded package to pypi.python.org, *TreeTime* can now be installed using pip

2018
^^^^

* October: Re-implemented the parent selection mechanism. The old cascaded menus have been replaced with single drop down lists.
* October: Re-furbished the GUI and removed a couple of bugs. Slighty changed the data file format. Implemented theme selection. Tested pyqtdeploy for deployment instead of pyinstaller. Updated the description.
* November: Released **version 2018-10**

2019
^^^^

* January: Implemented new field type "URL"

2020
^^^^

* June: Fixed problem with protected cells (typing into a cell without data could cause a crash), and fixed file selection dialog (now only offers .trt files).
* July: Implemented text export - single branches or complete trees can now be exported to txt files.
* August: Implemented time counters - nodes can record the time using a special field of type "timer" (experimental). GUI buttons can start and stop the stopwatch function.
* September: Added move-to-top-level option for first level nodes
* October: Added a dark and a light palette for GUI colours, selectable in addition to the theme selection.
* November: Fixed too slow editing in text fields when tree files are big (>1.5 MB).

2021
^^^^

* January: Released **version 2021.01**.
* January: Bugfixing (timer crash)
* February: Released **version 2021.2**.
* March: New functions "Delete node" and "Remove node from tree" now move descendants one level up.
  "Remove branch" removes the respective branch in all trees, "Delete branch" deletes a
  branch, all child branches and inter-connections in all trees.
* March: If a file with running timers is saved, those timers will be running when the file is loaded.
* March: Added tooltips for main buttons
* March: Implemented HTML export of branches and complete trees
* March: Added auto-delete for orphans
* March: Released **version 2021.3**

Present
-------

* Running: Bugfixing
* Running: Extend documentation on readthedocs.io
* Running: Add more examples and more template data files
  
Future
------

Near Future
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Implement search function

Mid Future
^^^^^^^^^^

* Implement global functions (Linearise Tree, Level-Swap, Merge identical Siblings, Merge Identical Parents/Children, Remove all Orphans, Insert all Orphans as Children)
* Implement tree export to PDF, and/or CSV
* Implement more tree field types (standard deviation, min, max, string concatenation),

Far Future
^^^^^^^^^^

* Implement tree field editing with graphical dialog (add, remove, change tree fields)
* Implement data item field editing with graphical dialog (add, remove, change data item fields)
* Implement safe usage by multiple simultaneous users
* Implement a database backend instead of text file storage
* Implement a web server
* A whole lot of other fancy things that will probably never get done
