# wxbtool

A toolkit for WeatherBench based on PyTorch

Warning: This project is at its early stage and the api is not very stable

Install
--------

```bash
pip install wxbtool
```

Cheat sheet
-----------

Start a data set server for 3-days prediction of t850 by Weyn's solution
```bash
wxb dserve -m wxbtool.specs.res5_625.t850weyn -s Setting3d
```

Start a training process for a UNet model following Weyn's solution
```bash
wxb train -m wxbtool.zoo.res5_625.unet.t850d3sm_weyn
```

Start a testing process for a UNet model following Weyn's solution
```bash
wxb test -m wxbtool.zoo.res5_625.unet.t850d3sm_weyn
```
