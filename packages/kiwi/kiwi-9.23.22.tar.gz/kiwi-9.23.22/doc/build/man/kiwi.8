.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
KIWI NG is an imaging solution that is based on an image XML description.
Such a description is represented by a directory which includes at least
one \fBconfig.xml\fP or \fB\&.kiwi\fP file and may as well include other files like
scripts or configuration data.
.sp
A collection of example image descriptions can be found on the github
repository here: \fI\%https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi\-descriptions\fP\&. Most of the
descriptions provide a so called appliance image. Appliance means that it\(aqs a small, text only based
image including a predefined remote source setup to allow installation of missing software
components at a later point in time.
.sp
KIWI NG operates in two steps. The system build command combines
both steps into one to make it easier to start with KIWI NG. The first
step is the preparation step and if that step was successful, a
creation step follows which is able to create different image output
types.
.sp
In the preparation step, you prepare a directory including the contents
of your new filesystem based on one or more software package source(s)
The creation step is based on the result of the preparation step and
uses the contents of the new image root tree to create the output
image.
.sp
KIWI NG supports the creation of the following image types:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ISO Live Systems
.IP \(bu 2
Virtual Disk for e.g cloud frameworks
.IP \(bu 2
OEM Expandable Disk for system deployment from ISO or the network
.IP \(bu 2
File system images for deployment in a pxe boot environment
.UNINDENT
.sp
Depending on the image type a variety of different disk formats and
architectures are supported.
.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-color\-output
Use Escape Sequences to print different types of information
in colored output. The underlaying terminal has to understand
those escape characters. Error messages appear red, warning
messages yellow and debugging information will be printed light
grey.
.TP
.BI \-\-config\fB= <configfile>
Use specified runtime configuration file. If not specified the
runtime configuration is looked up at \fB~/.config/kiwi/config.yml\fP
or \fB/etc/kiwi.yml\fP
.TP
.B \-\-debug
Print debug information on the commandline.
.TP
.BI \-\-logfile\fB= <filename>
Specify log file. the logfile contains detailed information about
the process.
.TP
.BI \-\-profile\fB= <name>
Select profile to use. The specified profile must be part of the
XML description. The option can be specified multiple times to
allow using a combination of profiles
.TP
.BI \-\-shared\-cache\-dir\fB= <directory>
Specify an alternative shared cache directory. The directory
is shared via bind mount between the build host and image
root system and contains information about package repositories
and their cache and meta data. The default location is set
to /var/cache/kiwi
.TP
.BI \-\-type\fB= <build_type>
Select image build type. The specified build type must be configured
as part of the XML description.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.sp
This version of KIWI NG uses a different caller syntax compared to
former versions. However there is a compatibility mode which allows
to use a legacy KIWI NG commandline as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
$ kiwi compat \e
    \-\-build kiwi\-descriptions/suse/x86_64/suse\-leap\-15.1 \e
