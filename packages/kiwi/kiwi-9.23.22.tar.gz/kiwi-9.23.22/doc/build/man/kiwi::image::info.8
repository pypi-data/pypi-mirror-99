.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Provides information about the specified image description.
If no specific info option is provided the command just
lists basic information about the image which could also be
directly obtained by reading the image XML description file.
Specifying an extension option like \fBresolve\-package\-list\fP
will cause a dependency resolver to run over the list of
packages and thus provides more detailed information about
the image description.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-repo\fB= <source,type,alias,priority>
Add repository with given source, type, alias and priority.
.TP
.BI \-\-description\fB= <directory>
The description must be a directory containing a kiwi XML
description and optional metadata files.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-repos
Ignore all repository configurations from the XML description.
Using that option is usally done with a sequence of \-\-add\-repo
options otherwise there are no repositories available for the
processing the requested image information which could lead
to an error.
.TP
.B \-\-resolve\-package\-list
Solve package dependencies and return a list of all
packages including their attributes e.g size,
shasum, and more.
.TP
.B \-\-print\-xml
Print image description in XML format. The given image
description is read in, transformed internally to XML and
send to the XSLT stylesheet processor. From there the result
gets validated using the RelaxNG schema and the schematron
rules. This result data will then be displayed. The typical
use case for this command is to turn an old image description
to the latest schema.
.TP
.B \-\-print\-yaml
Behaves the same like \fB\-\-print\-xml\fP except that after
validation the result data will be transformed into the
YAML format and displayed. Due to this processing the
command can be used for different operations:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Conversion of a given image description from or into
different formats. It\(aqs required to install the \fBanymarkup\fP
python module for this to work. The module is not a
hard requirement and loaded on demand. If not available
and a request to convert into a format different from XML
is made an exception will be thrown.
.IP \(bu 2
Update of an old image description to the latest schema
