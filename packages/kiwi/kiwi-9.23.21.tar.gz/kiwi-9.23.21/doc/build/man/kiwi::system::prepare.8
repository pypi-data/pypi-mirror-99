.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Create a new image root directory. The prepare step builds a new image
root directory from the specified XML description. The specified
root directory is the root directory of the new image root system.
As the root user you can enter this system via chroot as follows:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp

.ft C
$ chroot <directory> bash

.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-bootstrap\-package\fB= <name>
specify package to install as part of the early kiwi bootstrap phase.
The option can be specified multiple times
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-container\-label\fB= <name=value>
add a container label in the container configuration metadata. It
overwrites the label with the provided key\-value pair in case it was
already defined in the XML description
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-package\fB= <name>
specify package to add(install). The option can be specified
multiple times
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-repo\fB= <source,type,alias,priority,imageinclude,package_gpgcheck>
Add a new repository to the existing repository setup in the XML
description. This option can be specified multiple times.
For details about the provided option values see the \fB\-\-set\-repo\fP
information below
.TP
.B \-\-allow\-existing\-root
allow to re\-use an existing image root directory
.TP
.B \-\-clear\-cache
delete repository cache for each of the used repositories
before installing any package. This is useful if an image build
should take and validate the signature of the package from the
original repository source for any build. Some package managers
unconditionally trust the contents of the cache, which is ok for
cache data dedicated to one build but in case of kiwi the cache
is shared between multiple image builds on that host for performance
reasons.
.TP
.BI \-\-delete\-package\fB= <name>
specify package to delete. The option can be specified
multiple times
.TP
.BI \-\-description\fB= <directory>
Path to the kiwi XML description. Inside of that directory there
must be at least a config.xml of *.kiwi XML description.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-repos
Ignore all repository configurations from the XML description.
Using that option is usally done with a sequence of \-\-add\-repo
options otherwise there are no repositories available for the
image build which would lead to an error.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-repos\-used\-for\-build
Works the same way as \-\-ignore\-repos except that repository
configurations which has the imageonly attribute set to true
will not be ignored.
.TP
.BI \-\-root\fB= <directory>
Path to create the new root system.
.TP
.BI \-\-set\-repo\fB= <source,type,alias,priority,imageinclude,package_gpgcheck>
Overwrite the first repository entry in the XML description with the
provided information:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsource\fP
.sp
source url, pointing to a package repository which must be in a format
supported by the selected package manager. See the URI_TYPES section for
details about the supported source locators.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtype\fP
.sp
repository type, could be one of \fBrpm\-md\fP, \fBrpm\-dir\fP or \fByast2\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBalias\fP
.sp
An alias name for the repository. If not specified kiwi calculates
an alias name as result from a sha sum. The sha sum is used to uniquely
identify the repository, but not very expressive. We recommend to
set an expressive and uniq alias name.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpriority\fP
.sp
A number indicating the repository priority. How the value is evaluated
depends on the selected package manager. Please refer to the package
manager documentation for details about the supported priority ranges
and their meaning.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBimageinclude\fP
.sp
Set to either \fBtrue\fP or \fBfalse\fP to specify if this repository
should be part of the system image repository setup or not.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpackage_gpgcheck\fP
.sp
Set to either \fBtrue\fP or \fBfalse\fP to specify if this repository
should validate the package signatures.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-\-set\-container\-derived\-from\fB= <uri>
overwrite the source location of the base container for the selected
image type. The setting is only effective if the configured image type
is setup with an initial derived_from reference
.TP
.BI \-\-set\-container\-tag\fB= <name>
overwrite the container tag in the container configuration.
The setting is only effective if the container configuraiton
provides an initial tag value
.TP
.BI \-\-signing\-key\fB= <key\-file>
set the key file to be trusted and imported into the package
manager database before performing any opertaion. This is useful
if an image build should take and validate repository and package
signatures during build time. This option can be specified multiple
times.
