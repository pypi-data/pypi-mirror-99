    """
    Create a prediction for all the images in the directories specified 
    using the model specified.
    
    If evaluate_mode is False, the output folder(s) will contain:
        * the "raw" prediction for every image (if there are white pixels)
        * a geojson with the vectorized prediction, with a column "onborder"
          for each feature that is 1 if the feature is on the border of the
          tile, taking the border_pixels_to_ignore in account if applicable.
          This columns can be used to speed up union operations afterwards, 
          because only features on the border of tiles need to be unioned.
    
    If evaluate_mode is True, the results will all be put in the root of the 
    output folder, and the following files will be outputted:
        * the original image
        * the mask that was provided, if available
        * the "raw" prediction
        * a "cleaned" version of the prediction
    The files will in this case be prefixed with a number so they are ordered 
    in a way that is interesting for evaluation. If a mask was available, this
    prefix will be the % overlap of the mask and the prediction. If no mask is
    available, the prefix is the % white pixels in the prediction.
        
    Args
        input_image_dir (Pathlike): dir where the input images are located
        output_base_dir (Pathlike): dir where the output will be put
        output_vector_path (Pathlike): the path to write the vector output to
        classes (list): a list of the different class names. Mandatory 
            if more than background + 1 class.
        prediction_cleanup_params (dict, optional): parameters to specify which
            cleanups of the prediction need to be executed. 
            Default is None. 
        border_pixels_to_ignore: because the segmentation at the borders of the
            input images images is not as good, you can specify that x 
            pixels need to be ignored
        min_pixelvalue_for_save: the minimum pixel value that should be 
                present in the prediction to save the prediction
        input_mask_dir: optional dir where the mask images are located
        projection_if_missing: Normally the projection should be in the raster file. If it 
                    is not, you can explicitly specify one.
        batch_size: batch size to use while predicting. This must be choosen 
                depending on the neural network architecture and available 
                memory on you GPU.
        evaluate_mode: True to run in evaluate mode
        cancel_filepath: If the file in this path exists, processing stops asap
        force: False to skip images that already have a prediction, true to
               ignore existing predictions and overwrite them
