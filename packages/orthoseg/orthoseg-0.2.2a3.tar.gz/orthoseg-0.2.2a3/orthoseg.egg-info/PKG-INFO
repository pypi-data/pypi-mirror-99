Description: # Orthophoto segmentation
        
        This project provides a procedure and (python) scripts to make it (relatively) easy to 
        1. create a training dataset for a topic of your choice
        2. train a neural network to segment orthophotos
        3. apply the segmentation on a larger area + vectorize the result
        
        Only open source software is needed, eg. QGIS and tensorflow.
        
        Installation and usage instructions can be found in the [orthoseg wiki](https://github.com/theroggy/orthoseg/wiki)
