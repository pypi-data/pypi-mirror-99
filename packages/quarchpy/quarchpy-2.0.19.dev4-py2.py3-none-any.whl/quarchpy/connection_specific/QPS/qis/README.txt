Overview
========

	qis greatly simplifies the task of interfacing user scripts to the PPM. All time dependent code and 
	data decoding is hidden behind a TCP/IP server interface supporting both REST and raw TCP protocols.
	In addition, the live stream data passes through an internal intermediary buffer further simplifying
	the timing requirements of any interfacing scripts.
	
	See help.txt for more information.
