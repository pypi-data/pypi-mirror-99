(C)Quarch Technology Ltd 2019, QIS v1.19

qis:

	Greatly simplifies the task of interfacing user scripts to the PPM. All time dependent code and 
	data decoding is hidden behind a TCP/IP server interface supporting both REST and raw TCP protocols.
	In addition, the live stream data passes through an internal intermediary buffer further simplifying
	the timing requirements of any interfacing scripts.
	   
	On startup, qis creates a toolbar icon and optionally displays the inbuilt terminal interface. A 
	right click on the toolbar icon displays a menu with the following options:
		About
		Show Terminal
		Exit
		
	The Show Terminal menu item may appear disable/grayed out in the following circumstances
		A terminal window is already open
		The inbuilt terminal interface is disabled, see "The inbuilt terminal window".


	
Command line parameters:

	The files qis.bat, qis-NoGUI.bat (Windows) and qis.sh, qis-NoGUI.sh (Linux) contain examples of 
	command line parameter usage.

	-terminal 
		Displays a terminal window on application start. N.B. Only valid when the terminal window
		option is unlocked where locked is defined as when the file disableterminal.txt exists
		and is set to read only.

	-Djava.awt.headless=true
		This is a Java environment setting where Java is configured to run without GUI components 
		and qis will run in headless mode, no system tray icon or terminal window so interaction
		is only possible via a separate REST or TCP application.

	

Client side connections:

	REST is accepted on port 9780
	TCP  is accepted on port 9722, NB it is possible to connect via a standard Telnet client if said
	client supports raw mode, I recommend Putty.
	
	These port settings can be found and changed in the qis local directory file qis.properties.


	
The inbuilt terminal window:

	At startup qis opens a command/terminal window allowing the user immediate interaction without the
	need to script a connection or track down a copy of Putty. The opening of terminal window may be
	prevented by setting the qis local directory file disableterminal.txt to read only.
	
	     

$ Commands internal to qis:

	$help
		Displays copyright, license and help information.
		
		
		 
	$list 			
		List attached devices, eg
		
		1) usb::qtl1847-01-016
		2) rest::qtl1944-01-020
		3) tcp::qtl1944-01-020
	
	
	$list details
		List attached devices with additional information, eg
		
		1) usb::QTL1847-01-016 Port:9 Stream:Yes Name:XLC Programmable Power Module
		2) rest::QTL1999-02-020 IP:192.168.1.90 Port:80 NBName:1999-02-020 Stream:Yes Name:HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering
		3) tcp::QTL1999-02-020 IP:192.168.1.90 Port:9760 NBName:1999-02-020 Stream:Yes Name:HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering
	
	
	
	$scan
		Perform a scan for connected network attached devices via UPD port 30303. This command returns immediately 
		but the actual scan takes about 3 seconds to complete. It is recommended to wait 3 seconds before executing
		any other command. 
		
		N.B. USB devices are scanned automatically.
		
	
	$scan TCPIPdevicespecifier 
		Scan for a device at a specific tcp/ip address, eg
	
		$scan tcp::192.168.1.90
		Located Device: qtl1944-01-020
		
		$scan tcp::192.168.1.91
		No Quarch Device Found at: 192.168.1.91
	
		Once a device tcp/ip address has been scanned successfully the device will appear in the $list
		and is available for use.
	
	
	$debug [on|off]
	Sets debug mode.

	$debug?
	Returns current debug mode setting
	
	$debug history
	Returns the most recent debug messages.

	
	$default device
	$def device
		set device as the default target for all device commands, eg
		
		$default tcp::qtl1944-01-020
		hello?
		HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering
	
		The default device is unique to each client side connection, though due to the nature of
		http it may be unwise to rely on the connection been maintained during a REST session.  
		
		
	$default deviceListEntryNumber
	$def deviceListEntryNumber
		set device as default for all device commands, eg
		
		Assuming the $list command returns
		1) usb::qtl1824-03-161
		2) rest::qtl1944-01-020
		3) tcp::qtl1944-01-020
		
		$default 3
		Will set list entry 3) tcp::qtl1944-01-020 as the default device 
	
	
	$default?
	$def?
		Displays the current default device, eg
		
		$default?
		Default Device tcp::qtl1944-01-020
	
		
	
	$sysinfo
		Displays memory usage and stream task information, eg
			Used Memory: 36.591705 MB
			Free Memory: 34.908295 MB
			Total Memory: 71.500000 MB
			Max Memory: 1808.000000 MB
	
	
	
	$shutdown
		Close this application
	
	
	$sleep [integer value]
		the command will return after [integer value] milliseconds.
	
	
	$version
		Returns QIS version number

Non $ Commands internal to qis:

	Although the stream command is executed internally by qis it differs from the $ commands in that
	the targeted device may be specified on the the stream command line, eg
		
		stream text header
			Returns the stream header information from the most recent stream to be run on the current
			default device.

		usb::qtl1824-03-161 stream text header
			Returns the stream header information form the most recent stream to be run on 
			device usb::qtl1824-03-161
		
	
	stream?
		Returns running status and buffer information for the current stream operation, eg
		
		Stopped: User
		Stripes Buffered: 94 of 8388608
		
		Running
		Stripes Buffered: 1167 of 8388608
		
	
	stream text header
		Returns header information for the current stream operation eg

		stream text header
		Version: 5
		Format: 15
		Average: 14
	
		See Appendix A for examples of the header data returned by this command.
	
	stream text [all|number of stripes]
		The option all is subject to a limit of 4096 stripes.
		To ease timing considerations, qis implements an internal buffer of approximately
		8 million stripes.
		Returns N stripes in formatted ASCII text from the stream buffer, the format of each line is
		recordNumber statusFlags data specified by RECord:[channel]:[channel_type]:ENAble, eg
		
		stream text 3
		0 0 7 2 8 49
		1 0 7 2 8 50
		2 0 7 2 8 50
	
	
	stream bin [all|number of stripes]
		The option all is subject to a limit of 4096 stripes.
		To ease timing considerations, qis implements an internal buffer of approximately
		8 million stripes.
		Returns N stripes in binary format from the stream buffer.
	
	
	stream mode power [enable|disable]
		HD / XLC only. Enable/disable internal power calculation. Only valid when both voltage and current
		values are available for a given channel. Default is disabled
		
	stream mode power total
		HD / XLC only. Enable/disable internal power calculation and total power calculation. Only valid
		when two or more power calculations are enabled. Default is disabled and once enabled a stream 
		mode power [enable|disable] command will disable this option
	
	stream mode header [v1|v2|v3]
		PAM / HD / XLC only. Specify header mode. Default is device default. See Appendix A for header details.

	stream mode resample? 
	stream mode resample off
	stream mode resample 1..n[ms|us]
		Force stream data to specified resample period. If device period > resample period, device period
		will be used.
		The absolute maximum resample time is 2,147,483,647us or about 2,147 seconds, this is untested!

	
	tcp::DeviceIdentifier forcereset
	
	tcp::DeviceIdentifier forceIPAddress aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
	
	close
		closes the default or specified device connection. NB if a stream is in progress the stream is first stopped
		before the connection is closed therefore the actual close may happen a few seconds after the command is issued.
		For a USB connection any stream will be stopped
		For a TCP connection any stream will be stopped and the TCP connection will be closed
		
			close
			tcp::qtl1999-03-161 close
		
		
TCPIPdevicespecifier
	The TCP/IP device specifier has two general forms:
		interface::DeviceIdentifier
			tcp::qtl1944-01-020
			
		interface::IPAddress
			tcp::192.168.1.90
			
	Overrides for the protocol port number and message timeout may be appended to the device
	specifier, eg
		tcp::192.168.1.90:5432%3000
		
		Forces the device connection to use port number 5432 with a message timeout of 3000ms. The initial
		connection timeout for TCP is 10 times the message timeout. 
	
	
	
Any command not recognised by qis will be passed on to the current default device or to the device specified on the command line eg

	hello? 
	HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering
	
	usb::qtl1824-03-161 hello?
	XLC Programmable Power Module +Triggering

FAQ:
	Why does the client side REST interface default to port number 9780 instead of the standard
	port 80?
	In their infinite wisdom the Windows 10 designers hijack port 80 for their own needs.  	
	
	When I try to launch qis I see a dialogue box/terminal window saying the application is 
	"Shutting Down".
	qis supports two client side interfaces, REST and TCP, if neither interface can be claimed
	there is no means of communicating with client software so the application shuts down.   
	
	Can I increase the amount of memory available to qis/java?
	See Java documentation for the -Xmx launch option. eg -Xmx4096m would allow java to use up to
	4GB of system ram.
