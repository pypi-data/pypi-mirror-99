# --- Documentation for every config parameter that is available --- #
#
#    Main Parameters
#    ----------
#    n_files_train : int
#       Into how many files the training dataset should be split.
#       If you don't want to have this dataset, comment out the line or delete it!
#    n_files_validate : int
#       Into how many files the validation dataset should be split.
#       If you don't want to have this dataset, comment out the line or delete it!
#    n_files_rest : int
#       Into how many files the "rest" dataset should be split.
#       If you don't want to have this dataset, comment out the line or delete it!
#    output_file_folder : str
#       Path to the folder, where all the output .list files (and the bash job scripts) should be stored.
#    output_file_name : str
#       String, that specifies the prefix of the filename of the output .list files.
#       E.g. if = "xyzc_tight_0":
#       xyzc_tight_0_train_0.list, xyzc_tight_0_validate_0.list, ...
#    print_only : bool
#       If only informationa about the input_groups should be printed, and no .list files should be made.
#	shuffle_delete : bool
#		True = the input file that will be deleted after the shuffling is finished.
# 		Option for the shuffle_h5 tool.
#	venv_path : str
#		Path to a virtualenv, e.g. "/home/hpc/capn/mppi033h/.virtualenv/python_3_env/"
#	make_qsub_bash_files : bool		
#		true = Makes the cluster submission bash files needed to actually
# 		concatenate the files in the list files.


#    Input Group Parameters
#    ----------------------
#    dir : str
#       Path of the directory, where the files for this input group are located.
#    run_ids_train/run_ids_validate/run_ids_rest : array
#       Array, which specifies the range of the run_ids, that should be used for the training/validation.rest
#       dataset of this input group.
#       E.g. if [1,5], the script will put files from this input group with run_ids from 1 to 5 (including 1 and 5)
#       to the training/validation/rest dataset.
#       If you don't want to use a specific dataset for this input group, comment out the line or delete it!
