Description: # c2cgeoform
        
        c2cgeoform is a framework easing the creation of web pages with forms. Users
        of c2cgeoform declaratively create *models*, from which the framework
        can create forms, views, lists, ...
        
        c2cgeoform supports various data types, including *geometry* types (points,
        lines, polygons). For geometry types `c2geoform` generates maps with editing
        tools to create, modify or delete geometries.
        
        c2cgeoform is based on [Pylons technologies](http://www.pylonsproject.org/).
        More specifically, it uses
        [Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html),
        [Colander](http://colander.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), and
        [Deform](http://deform.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). For interacting with the
        database it uses [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and
        [GeoAlchemy 2](https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
