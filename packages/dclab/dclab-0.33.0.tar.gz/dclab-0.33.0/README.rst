real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) datasets; an essential part of
`Shape-Out <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut2>`__.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation, including the code reference and examples, is available at
`dclab.readthedocs.io <https://dclab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.


Installation

Information for developers
--------------------------


Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main branch for developing dclab is master.
If you want to make small changes like one-liners,
documentation, or default values in the configuration,
you may work on the master branch. If you want to change
more, please (fork dclab and) create a separate branch,
e.g. ``my_new_feature_dev``, and create a pull-request
once you are done making your changes.
Please make sure to edit the 
`Changelog <https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/dclab/blob/master/CHANGELOG>`__. 

**Very important:** Please always try to use ::


    git pull --rebase

instead of::

    git pull

to prevent confusions in the commit history.

Tests
~~~~~
dclab is tested using pytest. If you have the time, please write test
methods for your code and put them in the ``tests`` directory. To run
the tests, install `pytest` and run::

    pytest tests


Incrementing version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dclab currently gets its version from the latest git tag.
If you think that a new version should be published,
create a tag on the master branch (if you have the necessary
permissions to do so)::

    git tag -a "0.1.3"
    git push --tags origin

Appveyor and TravisCI will then automatically build source package and wheels 
and publish them on PyPI.
