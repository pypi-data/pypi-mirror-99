Example
-------

Run "du" to show disk usage for directory _/usr_ in megabytes, pipe the output to
"pyxdu", sort directories in numerical order:

```shell
du -m /usr | pyxdu -n
```

Installation
------------

You can install pyxdu on Python 3.7 or newer using pip:

```shell
pip install pyxdu
```


Description
-----------

_Pyxdu_ is a program for displaying a graphical tree of disk space utilization as
reported by the UNIX utility "du". The user can navigate through the tree structure and
change the order of the displayed information. The window is divided up into several
columns, each of which is one level deeper in the directory hierarchy (from left to
right). Boxes are drawn for each directory. The amount of vertical space occupied by
each box is directly proportional to the amount of disk space consumed by it and all of
its children. The name of each directory and the amount of data are displayed provided
that there is enough space within its box. Any space at the "bottom" of a box not
covered by its children to the right represents the space consumed by files _in_ that
directory (as opposed to space from its children).

There are several command line options available.

* `-h --help`
  * Show help message.
* `-s`
  * ~~Don't display sizes.~~ (not supported yet)
* `-a`
  * Sort in alphabetical order.
* `-n`
  * Sort in numerical order (the largest first).
* `-r`
  * Reverse sense of sort (e.g. `-rn` means the smallest first).
* `-c <num>`
  * Display `<num>` columns \[default: 6\].
* `--foreground <color>`
  * ~~Determines the color of the text and lines.~~ (not supported yet)
* `--background <color>`
  * ~~Determines the color of the background.~~ (not supported yet)
* `--dump <file>`
  * Dump tree as JSON for debugging.

Mouse Actions
-------------

The user can move up or down the tree by clicking the left mouse on a directory box. If
the left most box is selected, the display will move up one level (assuming you are not
already at the root). If any other box is selected, it will be placed against the left
edge of the window, and the display will be rescaled appropriately. ~~At any time the
middle mouse will bring you back to the root. Clicking the right mouse will exit the
program.~~ (not supported yet)


Keystrokes
----------

* `1-9`, `0`
  * Sets the number of columns in the display (0 = 10).
* `a`
  * Alphabetical sort.
* `n`
  * Numerical sort (the largest first).
* `f`
  * First-in-first-out sort (this is the order the data was read into the program).
* `l`
  * Last-in-first-out sort.
* `r`
  * Reverse sense of sort.
* `s`
  * ~~Toggle size display.~~ (not supported yet)
* `h`
  * ~~Display a popup help window.~~ (not supported yet)
* `i`
  * ~~Display information about the current root node to standard out. The first line
    shows the path within the tree, the total size from this node on down, and the
    percentage that total represents of all the data given to xdu. Subsequent lines show
    the size and name information for all children of this node in the order they are
    currently sorted in. This allows tiny directories to be seen that otherwise could
    not be labeled on the display, and also allows for cutting and pasting of the
    information.~~ (not supported yet)
* `/`
  * Goto the root.
* `q`, `Escape`
  * Exit the program.


Development
-----------
