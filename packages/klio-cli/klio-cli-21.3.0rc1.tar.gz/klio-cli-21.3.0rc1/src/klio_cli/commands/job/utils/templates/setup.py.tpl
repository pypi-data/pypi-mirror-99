"""Setup.py module for the workflow's worker utilities.

All the Klio job-related code is gathered in a package that will be
built as a source distribution (via `python setup.py sdist`, staged in
the staging area (as defined in `klio-job.yaml` under `pipeline_options.
staging_location`) for the job being run and then installed in the
Dataflow workers when they start running.

This behavior is triggered by specifying the `setup_file` value under
`pipeline_options` in `klio-job.yaml` when running a Klio job.

This approach is adapted from
  https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/
          examples/complete/juliaset/setup.py.
