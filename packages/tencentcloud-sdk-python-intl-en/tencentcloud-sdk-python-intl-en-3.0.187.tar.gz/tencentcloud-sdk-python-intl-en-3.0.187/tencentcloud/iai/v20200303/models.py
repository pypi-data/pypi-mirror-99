Otherwise, the new person will be created. 
0: do not judge, i.e., the person will be created no matter whether a duplicate person exists in the group. 
1: low duplicate person judgment requirement (1% FAR); 
2: average duplicate person judgment requirement (0.1% FAR); 
3: high duplicate person judgment requirement (0.01% FAR); 
4: very high duplicate person judgment requirement (0.001% FAR).

3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension.

        :param Score: Similarity between given face image and `PersonId`. If there are multiple faces under the `PersonId`, the score of the highest similarity will be returned.

The returned similarity score varies by algorithm version.
If you need to verify whether the faces in the two images are the same person, then the 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001% FARs on v3.0 correspond to scores of 40, 50, and 60, respectively. Generally, if the score is above 50, it can be judged that they are the same person.
The 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001% FARs on v2.0 correspond to scores of 70, 80, and 90, respectively. Generally, if the score is above 80, it can be judged that they are the same person.
        :type Score: float

        :param Image: Base64-encoded data of the image.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
If there are multiple faces in the image, only the face with the largest size will be selected.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.

        :param Url: Image URL 
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
 Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used. 
We recommend storing the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. 
The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
If there are multiple faces in the image, only the face with the largest size will be selected.

        :param QualityControl: Image quality control. 
0: no control. 
1: low quality requirement. The image has one or more of the following problems: extreme blurriness, covered eyes, covered nose, and covered mouth. 
2: average quality requirement. The image has at least three of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, blurriness or average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension. 
Default value: 0. 
If the image quality does not meet the requirement, the returned result will prompt that the detected image quality is unsatisfactory.

If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
