Indi game engine core module
-------------------------------------------------------------

Indi game engine is a multi-platform game engine developed by indi games.

Since the code built in python runs on the smartphone as it is, you can easily create a smartphone app.

Since 3D rendering is very fast, you can develop full-scale 3D games.

OpenCV, Dlib, and numpy can also be used, so you can create apps that use machine learning.

I would like to support the deep learning framework in the future.

It is currently a pre-alpha version and only works on Windows(32/64)

Specifications may change without notice.

In the spring of 2020, we will announce a version that can develop smartphone apps.
