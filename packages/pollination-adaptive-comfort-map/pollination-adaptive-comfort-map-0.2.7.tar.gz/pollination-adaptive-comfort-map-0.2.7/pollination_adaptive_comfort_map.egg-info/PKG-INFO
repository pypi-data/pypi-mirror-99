Description: # Adaptive Comfort Map
        
        Adaptive thermal comfort map recipe for Pollination.
        
        Compute spatially-resolved operative temperature and adaptive thermal comfort from
        a Honeybee model and EPW. Raw results are written into a `results/` folder and
        include CSV matrices of hourly operative temperatures and thermal conditions. Processed
        metrics of Thermal Comfort Percent (TCP) can be found in the `metrics/` folder.
        
        ## Methods
        
        This recipe uses EnergyPlus to obtain longwave radiant temperatures and indoor air
        temperatures. The outdoor air temperature and air speed are taken directly from the EPW.
        A Radiance-based enhanced 2-phase method is used for shortwave MRT calculations,
        which includes an accurate direct sun calculation using precise solar positions. The
        energy properties of the model geometry are what determine the outcome of the
        simulation and the model's SensorGrids are what determine where the comfort
        mapping occurs.
        
        To determine Thermal Comfort Percent (TCP), the occupancy schedules of the energy
        model are used. Any hour of the occupancy schedule that is 0.1 or greater will be
        considered occupied. All hours of the outdoor are considered occupied.
