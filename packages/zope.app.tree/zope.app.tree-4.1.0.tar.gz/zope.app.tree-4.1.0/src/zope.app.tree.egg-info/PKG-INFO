        This package was designed to be a light-weight and easy-to-use static tree
        implementation. It allows the developer to quickly create trees with nodes
        that can be opened and closed without the use of JavaScript. The tree state
        can be retained over multiple sessions.

         CHANGES
        =========
        
        4.1.0 (2021-03-22)
        ==================
        
        - Add support for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.
        
        - Add support for ``zope.component >= 5``.
        
        - Drop support for Python 3.4.
        
        - Update PyPy versions.
        
        
        4.0.0 (2017-05-16)
        ==================
        
        - Add support for Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and PyPy.
        
        - Fix #264614: Test for node filter didn't do what it was expected to do.
        
        - Import ISite from zope.component after it was moved there from
          zope.location.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-02-01)
        ==================
        
        - Converted from using zope.app.container to zope.container.
        
        3.5.1 (2009-01-29)
        ==================
        
        - Add compatibility for newer zope.traversing releases that require us
          to explicitly set up testing. This also works with older releases.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-01-17)
        ==================
        
        - Get rid of zope.app.zapi dependency, replacing its uses with
          direct imports.
        
        - Clean up dependencies, move testing and rotterdam dependencies
          to extra requires.
        
        - Fix mailing list address to zope-dev@zope.org instead of retired
          zope3-dev@zope.org. Change `cheeseshop` to `pypi` in the package
          url.
        
        - Replace __used_for__ in adapters.py with zope.component.adapts
          calls to make more sense.
        
        - Remove obsolete zpkg files, zcml include file for mkzopeinstance-based
          installations, versions.txt that makes no sense now.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-28)
        ==================
        
        - Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
        
        v1.2 (2004-02-19) -- 'Scruffy'
        ==============================
        
        - Moved to `zope.app.tree`
        
        - It is now called 'ZopeTree' again.  Hoorray!
        
        - Refactored browser stuff into its own browser subpackage.
        
        - Separated the handling of tree state from the cookie functionality
          to provide a base class for views based on other tree state sources.
        
        v1.1 (2004-02-16) -- 'Zapp'
        ===========================
        
        - Added support for displaying lines in a tree (Stephan Richter)
        
          - Changes in `Node.getFlatDict()` to provide more data.  Removed
            'depth' from node info, but added 'row-state' and
            'last-level-node'.  Changed interface and test accordingly.
        
          - Updated templates for `StaticTree` skin and example.  Note that
            third party templates from 1.0.x will not work anymore and must be
            updated as well!
        
        v1.0.1 (2004-01-16) -- 'Nibbler'
        ================================
        
        - Added last remaining pieces for unit tests
        
        - Updated documentation
        
        - Rounded some rough edges in the skin
        
        - Integrated it into the Zope3 distribution below the `zope.products`
          package
        
        v1.0 (2003-11-24) -- 'Lur'
        ==========================
        
        - Ported to Zope 3
        
        - Renamed it to 'statictree'
        
        - Much more unit tests
        
        - Added filter functionality
        
        - Provided sample implementations as well as an alternate
          rotterdam-like skin using the static tree
