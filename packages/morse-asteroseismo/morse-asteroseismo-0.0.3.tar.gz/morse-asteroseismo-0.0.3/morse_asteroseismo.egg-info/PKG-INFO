Description: # The MOde Regularity SEarcher (morse)
        **A Python package to interpret the oscillation spectrum of γ Doradus and Slowly Pulsating B stars.**
        
        γ Doradus and SPB stars pulsate in low-frequency gravito-inertial modes 
        that carry information about their internal structure and rotation profile.
        This package allows you to perform mode identification, measure the mean rotation
        rate and buoyancy radius of these pulsators from a list of frequencies extracted from the
        oscillation spectrum. morse has been primarily designed to deal with moderately 
        and fastly rotating pulsators but, to some extent, is also of interest for slowly
        rotating stars.
