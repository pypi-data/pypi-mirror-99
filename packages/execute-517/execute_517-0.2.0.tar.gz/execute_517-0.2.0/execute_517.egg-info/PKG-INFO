Description: Run a command in a PEP 517 env
        ------------------------------
        
        This package allows you to run any Python command inside the build environment specified by the ``pyproject.toml`` file. This may be useful for executing specific ``setup.py`` commands inside an env where all the dependencies are available.
        
        For example to get the version of a package run the following command in the root of the repository::
        
          $ execute-517 "setup.py --version"
