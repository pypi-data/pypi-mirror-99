For information on how to install Python on your computer, refer to the official website [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\nFor the program to run, a properly formatted database created by falocalrepo needs to be present in the same folder.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nfalocalrepo-server <database> [<host>:<port>]\n```\n\nThe server needs one argument pointing at the location of a valid [falocalrepo](https://pypi.org/project/falocalrepo/) database and accepts an optional argument to manually set host and port. By default, the server is run on 0.0.0.0:8080.\n\nOnce the server is running - it will display status messages in the terminal - the web app can be accessed at http://0.0.0.0:8080/, or any manually set host/port combination.\n\n_Note:_ All the following paths are meant as paths from `<host>:<port>`.\n\nThe root folder `/` displays basic information on the database and has links to perform submissions and journal searches.\n\n### Users\n\nThe `/user/<username>` path displays basic statistics of a user stored in the database. Clicking on gallery/scraps or journals counters opens submissions and journals by the user respectively.\n\nThe `/submissions/<username>` and `/journals/<username>` paths open submissions and journals by the user respectively.\n\n### Search\n\nThe server search interface allows to search submissions, journals, and users. Respectively, these can be reached at `/search/submissions`, `/search/journals`, and `/search/users`. The `/search/` path defaults to submissions search.\n\nThe interface supports searching all columns of the three tables. In addition to those, the `Any` option will match to any field, and the advanced `SQL` option allows to use SQLite [`WHERE`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html#whereclause) queries.\n\nTo add a field, click on the `Add Field`, then select the search field in the drop-down menu beside the newly created input box.\n\nFields can be added multiple times and will act as OR options. The `SQL` option will override other fields.\n\nFields are matched using the SQLite [`like`](https://sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#like) expression which allows for limited pattern matching. See [`database` command](https://gitlab.com/MatteoCampinoti94/FALocalRepo#database) for more details.\n\nThe `Sort By` and `Order` selections allow to sort and order results using any field.\n\nThe `View` option allows to switch from a list view to a grid view of the search results. The view selector and grid view are only supported for submission searches, all others will default to the list view.\n\nThe `/submissions/<username>/`, `/gallery/<username>/`, `/scraps/<username>/`, `/favorites/<username>/`, `/mentions/<username>/`, and `/journals/<username>/` paths allow to quickly open a search for submissions, favorites,  and journals associated to `<username>`. `/search/submissions/<username>/`, `/search/gallery/<username>/`, etc. are valid aliases.\n\n### Browse\n\nThe `/browse/submissions`, `/browse/journals`, and `/browse/users` paths allow to open a list of all entries in a specific table. From there the results can be refined using the search interface. \n\n### Submissions & Journals\n\nSubmissions and journals can be accessed respectively at `/submission/<id>` and `/journal/<id>`. All the metadata, content and files that are recorded in the database are displayed in these pages.\n\nSubmission files can be accessed at `/submission/<id>/file` or by using the `Download File` or `Download Submission as ZIP` buttons.\n\nFor both submissions and journals it is possible to download a ZIP containing the metadata in a JSON-formatted file and the submission description/journal content in HTML format. For submissions, the ZIP file also contains the submission file. The ZIP of a submission/journal can be accessed directly using the `/submission/<id>/zip` and `/journal/<id>/zip` paths.\n',
