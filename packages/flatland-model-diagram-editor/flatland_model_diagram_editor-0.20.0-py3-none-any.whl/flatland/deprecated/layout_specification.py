# Connector Layout Specification

# The number of equally spaced positions relative to a center position (included in the count) on a Node face where
# a Stem can be attached. A value of one corresponds to a single connection point in the center of a Node face.
# A value of three is a central connection point with one on either side, and so on. In practice, five is usually the
# right number, especially for a class or state diagram.  But this could vary by diagram and node type in the future.
default_stem_positions = 5

# The number of ruts where Path can be defined in a Lane
# These work like stem/anchor positions on a Lane as opposed to a Node face
# For a value of 3 we get positions -1, 0 and +1 with 0 representing the Lane Center
# and +1 high/right and -1 low/left
default_rut_positions = 5

# For a Stem that has no graphic decoration, such as an xUML class binary association connection or a xUML subclass
# connection, this is the minimum distance from the node face to either a bend or the opposing Stem end. It prevents
# a bend too close to a Node face or a connection too close to another Node.
