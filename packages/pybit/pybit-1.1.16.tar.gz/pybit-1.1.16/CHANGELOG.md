# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.16] - 2020-03-21

### Modified

- Fixed typo errors on endpoint urls.

## [1.1.15] - 2020-03-21

### Added

- Added support for futures endpoints on `HTTP` (using `isdigit` to detect futures symbols).

### Modified

- Using `get` method for `dict` for symbol check instead of calling by key.
- `endpoint` on `HTTP` will now default to https://api.bybit.com if no argument.
- `retry_codes` is now user-definable in the `HTTP` arguments.
- All logging is now on `DEBUG` level—user will need to manually set `logging_level` to `DEBUG`.
- Added attempted request to `FailedRequestError` and `InvalidRequestError` for improved error logging.

## [1.1.14] - 2020-02-06

### Modified

- Fixed unexpected `tuple` generation for status codes on `InvalidRequestError` and
  `FailedRequestError`.
- Fixed how `Websocket` handles incoming `orderBook` data due to Bybit's topic naming changes.

## [1.1.13] - 2020-02-01

### Modified

- `requests` will use `JSONDecodeError` from `simplejson` if it is available—`pybit` will now do the same to prevent
  errors.
- Fixed a bug where `HTTP` retry would crash on rate limit reached due to undefined variable.
- Improved `InvalidRequestError` and `FailedRequestError` to include error codes and times.

## [1.1.12] - 2020-01-20

### Modified

- `WebSocket` will now temporarily differentiate between inverse and linear endpoints for the 'order' topic
  since incoming data has differing keys.

## [1.1.11] - 2020-01-12

### Added

- `WebSocket` now has `purge_on_fetch` (defaults to `True`), which allows the user to keep data between fetches.

### Modified

- Fixed a bug on 'stop_order' for `WebSocket` that would prevent data from being appended due to deprecation 
  of `stop_order_id`.

## [1.1.10] - 2020-01-08

- See release candidates for details.

## [1.1.10rc0] - 2020-01-05

### Modified

- Rewrote if-condition on `_on_message` in `WebSocket` class to check for linear or non-linear position data.

## [1.1.9] - 2020-12-20

### Modified

- Added ability to handle `from` using `from_time` and `from_id` arguments since `from` is a
  reserved keyword.
- Removed `ignore_retries_for` from `HTTP`. `pybit` now uses a standard list of non-critical errors that can
  be retried.
- Added argument `retry_delay` for `HTTP`—allows user to add a custom retry delay for each retry.

## [1.1.8] - 2020-11-21

- See release candidates for details.

## [1.1.8rc4] - 2020-11-14

### Modified

- Fixed raise error missing argument for `FailedRequestError` upon max retries.
- Modified API endpoints to saistfy requirements for upcoming endpoint deprecation,
  see the [API Documentation](https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/inverse/#t-introduction)
  for more info.
- Updated `WebSocket` class to properly handle `candle` from USDT perpetual streams.
- Updated `WebSocket` class to return a copy of the collected data, preventing establishing
  a reference.
- Updated `WebSocket` class to properly handle linear (USDT) orderbook data.
- Performance improvements.

## [1.1.8rc3] - 2020-11-12

### Modified

- Changed `ignore_retries_for` default argument to be empty tuple to prevent error.

## [1.1.8rc2] - 2020-10-27

### Added

- Added `ignore_retries_for` argument to `HTTP` `auth` method, allowing the user
  to choose which error codes should NOT be retried.

## [1.1.8rc1] - 2020-10-27

### Added

- `FailedRequestError` and `InvalidRequestError` now have `message` and `status_code`
  attributes.

## [1.1.8rc0] - 2020-10-27

### Added

- Will now catch and handle `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

## [1.1.7] - 2020-10-21

### Added

- Added `recv_window` error handler to `HTTP` `auth` method.
- Will now catch and handle `requests.exceptions.SSLError`.

## [1.1.6] - 2020-10-09

### Modified

- Added `recv_window` argument to `HTTP` class.

## [1.1.5] - 2020-09-30

### Modified

- Improved error handling.
- Added `max_retries` argument to `HTTP` class.

## [1.1.4] - 2020-09-17

### Modified

- Added `FailedRequestError` to differentiate between failed requests and
  invalid requests.
- Fixed `exit` method on `WebSocket` to now properly handle the closing of the socket.

## [1.1.3] - 2020-09-12

### Modified

- Increased expires time for WebSocket authentication to a full second.

## [1.1.2] - 2020-09-12

### Modified

- Add option to handle timeout on request submission.

## [1.1.1] - 2020-09-11

### Modified

- Fixed trailing decimal zero to prevent auth signature errors.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-09-08

### Added

- New `HTTP` methods.
- New argument for `HTTP` class to log each outgoing request.
- New argument for `WebSocket` class to attempt restart after an error is
  detected.

### Modified

- Mass simplification of all methods—each method now takes a series keyword
  arguments rather than a set number of required pre-defined arguments. This
  makes the library future-proof and prevents breaking on significant updates 
  to the REST API endpoints. This, however, requires the user to study the
  API documentation and know which arguments are required for each endpoint. 
- One new exception has been added—`InvalidRequestError`. This exception will be
  raised if Bybit returns with an error, or if `requests` is unable to complete
  the request.
- Inverse and Linear endpoints are now handled accordingly by differentiating
  from the symbol argument.
- Updated existing `HTTP` method names to follow the same naming procedure as 
  listed in the Bybit API documentation.
- Reformatting of code to follow PEP-8 standards.
- New docstring format.


## [1.0.2] - 2020-04-05

### Added

- Various logging features added to both HTTP and WebSocket classes.

### Modified

- Extensive WebSocket class updates.
  - Modified the WebSocketApp to send a heartbeat packet every 30 seconds,
    with a timeout of 10 seconds. These settings can be modified using the
    'ping_interval' and 'ping_timeout' arguments of the WebSocket
    constructor.
  - User no longer needs to manage the incoming stream; `pybit` does all the
  work (insert, update, delete).
  - Modified `ws.ping()` for ease of use; simply use the function to send
  heartbeat packets. When something happens to the connection, Python will
  raise an `Exception` which the end-user can catch and handle.
- Redundancy updates to the HTTP class.
- Modified the HTTP class to use an endpoint argument, allowing users to
  take advantage of the USDT endpoints.

## [1.0.1] - 2020-04-03

### Modified

- The setup.py file has been fixed to correctly install the pybit package.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-04-03

### Added

- The `pybit` module.
- MANIFEST, README, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG files.
