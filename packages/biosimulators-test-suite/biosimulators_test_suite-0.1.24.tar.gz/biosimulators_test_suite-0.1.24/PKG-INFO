        BioSimulators test suite
        ========================
        
        The BioSimulators test suite is a tool for validating that biosimulation
        software tools implement the `BioSimulators standards for biosimulation
        tools <https://biosimulators.org/standards>`__.
        
        The test suite is composed of two parts:
        
        -  `A collection of example modeling projects <examples>`__. Each
           project is represented by a single `COMBINE/OMEX
           archive <https://combinearchive.org/>`__ that contains one or more
           simulation experiments described using the `Simulation Experiment
           Description Markup Language (SED-ML) <https://sed-ml.org>`__ and one
           or more models described using a format such as the `BioNetGen
           Language (BNGL) <https://bionetgen.org>`__ or the `Systems Biology
           Markup Language (SBML) <http://sbml.org>`__.
        
        -  Software for checking that biosimulation tools execute these projects
           according to the BioSimulators standards.
        
           -  Simulation tools support the `BioSimulators standard command-line
              arguments <https://biosimulators.org/standards/simulator-interfaces>`__.
           -  Simulation tools support the `BioSimulators conventions for Docker
              images <https://biosimulators.org/standards/simulator-images>`__.
           -  Simulation tools follow the `BioSimulators conventions for
              executing simulations described by SED-ML files in COMBINE/OMEX
              archives <https://biosimulators.org/standards/simulation-experiments>`__.
           -  Simulation tools support the `BioSimulators conventions for the
              outputs of SED-ML files in COMBINE/OMEX
              archives <https://biosimulators.org/standards/simulation-reports>`__.
