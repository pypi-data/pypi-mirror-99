Although `nbdev` looks to be a very\nmature and comprehensive tool, it is quite opinionated. This package is an\ninvestigation into what a smaller `nbdev` might look like.\n\n## Philosophy\n1. **Low mental overhead**   \n Realistically, most Python programmers that wish to write packages need to have some\n familiarity with the Python package development model, including the conventional\nstructure of a package. For this reason, I feel that it is important to design\n`literary` such that these skills translate directly to designing libraries with\nnotebooks\n2. **Minimal downstream impact**  \n Users of `literary` packages should not realise that they are consuming \n notebook-generated code at runtime. This means that a pure-Python package needs to\n be generated from the notebooks, and it must use the conventional import model. For\n this reason, `literary` should only exist as a development dependency of\n the package.\n  \n\n## Differences with `nbdev`\n* Use of cell tags instead of comments or magics to dictate exports\n* Use of `nbconvert` machinery to build the pure-Python lib package\n* Use of import hooks to import other notebooks\n    * Maintains a similar programming model to conventional module\n development\n    * Reduces the need to modify notebook contents during conversion \n* Minimal runtime overhead\n    * Features like `patch` are removed from the generated module (& imported notebook source) using AST transformations\n* Currently no documentation generation\n    * Loosely, the plan is to use existing notebook-book tooling to re-use the\n     existing Jupyter ecosystem\n\n\n## Differences with Knuth\nKnuth introduced the `tangle` and `weave` programs to produce separate documentation and source code for compilation. \nLiterary differs in treating the notebook as the "ground truth" for documentation + testing, and generating smaller source code for packaging.\n\n\n## Design\nThe plan for this package is:\n1. Notebooks will be written inside `<PACKAGE_NAME>/` in literary project\'s root directory\n2. Notebooks will respect relative imports and other pure-Python features to minimise the differences between the generated packages and the notebooks\n3. A pure-python generated `lib/<PACKAGE_NAME>/` directory will be built before Poetry builds the final project.   \n  E.g. \n    ```toml\n    [tool.poetry]\n    # ...\n    packages = [\n      { include = "<PACKAGE_NAME>", from = "lib" },\n    ]\n    ```\n',
