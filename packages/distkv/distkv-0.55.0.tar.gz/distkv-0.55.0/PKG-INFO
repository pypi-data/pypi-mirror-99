Description: ======
        DistKV
        ======
        
        Welcome to `DistKV <https://github.com/smurfix/distkv>`__!
        
        DistKV is a master-less distributed key-value storage system. It
        circumvents the CAP theorem by assuming that keys are usually only changed
        by one node. It is resistant to partitioning and intended to be always-on;
        it might delay – but will not lose – updates even in a partitioned network.
        
        DistKV comes with several batteries included:
        
        * Basic user management, pattern-based ACLs
        
        * Strong typing, code- and/or `JSON Schema`-based
        
        * Data mangling
        
        * Background code execution
        
        * Seamless recovery even if only one master is running
        
        * a MQTT 3.1 back-end that stores persistent data in DistKV,
          based on hbmqtt
        
        API
        ===
        
        DistKV offers an efficient msgpack-based interface to access data and to
        change internal settings. Most configuration is stored inside DistKV
        itself.
        
        Stored data are **not** forced to be strings or binary sequences, but can
        be anything that `MsgPack` supports. Keys to storage are multi-level and
        support string, integer/float, and list keys.
        
        
        Non-Features
        ============
        
        DistKV does not support data partitioning. Every node stores the whole
        data set and can instantly deliver mostly-uptodate data.
        
        DistKV does not have a disk-based storage backend; periodic snapshots and
        event logs can be used to quickly restore a system, if necessary.
        
        Status
        ======
        
        DistKV is mostly stable. There are a lot of corner cases that don't
        have tests yet
        
        TODOs:
        * some services (esp. command line tools and runners) are under-tested
        * there's no good API for errors
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.41: the message monitor can do multiple subpaths and only reports initial-load-complete once
        
        0.40: use asyncscope for running subsystems in a reasonable way
        
        0.35: allow forgetting nodes (if they have no data attached)
        
        0.30: major API refactoring: paths are now separate objects
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * update the whole ecosystem to anyio 2.0 (asyncclick asyncscope …)
        
        * clean up some of the more egregious command line mistakes
        
        * create a page for showcase-ing subprojects (distinv knx owfs akumuli …)
        
        * improve Home Assistant integration
