Sale Automatic Workflow - Payment Mode
======================================

This module is a glue for **Account Payment Sale** (of the OCA/bank-payment
project) and **Sale Automatic Workflow**.

When a payment mode is associated with an automatic workflow, this one
is automatically selected for the sales orders using this method.

Installation
============

As soon as both **Account Payment Mode** and **Sale Automatic Workflow**
are installed, this module is installed.

Configuration
=============

The automatic workflow associated to a payment mode can be chosen in
the configuration of the payment modes in the Invoicing configuration menu.

Usage
=====

When a payment mode is selected on a sales order, if it has an
automatic workflow, the sales order will use it.
